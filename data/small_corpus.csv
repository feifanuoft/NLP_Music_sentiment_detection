1,4.0,False,"02 1, 2013",A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},Mr. Jeep,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)",I used to be a fan,1359676800,

The songs that she had compiled for her album, The Pink Print have simply been more less of her persona, more of other rappers and entertainers, and sadly it has absolutely been a complete waste of time overall. Her latest collaboration which isn't enough of her, but mostly all of Drake isn't worth it. Truffle Butter isn't exactly one of her better songs. It overall shows Nicki has lost her voice and instead made a so-called A-List rapper into an absolute joke. I think the song is absolutely not only worth its money, but shows she honestly has run out of good songs to mix her own voice. Truffle Butter is absolutely not only a waste of time, but a song worth passing up. For someone who did Starships as a hit, she now has to find herself again.

I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, ""Time To Say Goodbye."" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not ""punk."" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls ""unchartered musical territory.""

Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc.  You want to know the sad part?  BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually.  Why?  Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly.  Yeah, whatever.  I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart??  For shame!)  Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes.  Either they need to do one of two things:
1.  Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).
2.  Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set.  That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs.  The only problem here that will undoubtedly crop up is the tendency to slaughter the cover art on Beatles records, and these make nice contrasting pictures, although the Red is from PLEASE PLEASE ME.

I really don't know where to start with this one. This band rips off every band from U2 to Green Day to The Killers, and manages to sound overproduced with a total lack of energy, with the exception of ONE pop-punk track, ""Time To Say Goodbye."" It was said that during the three-plus years that passed between albums, that the group's singer/songriter Ryan Bouvier had writer's block. This becomes all the more apparent because Britney Spears' songwriting team was brought in to write several songs, making Simple Plan sound like a boy band. Even when they try to rock out, the production is so overdone that the guitars seem distorted and out of place. And there are WAY too many piano-ballads. I think any trace of the faux-punk label they were slapped with after their first two albums, which were decent efforts packed with pop-punk hooks, can permanently be removed now. Simple Plan will spend the rest of their lives wondering if it was the three-plus year layoff between albums or the change of sound/style on this new one that killed their career. And the answer is neither. It is the lack of originality, energy, and songcraft that will do them in. Lets face it, when Hilary Duff rocks harder than you, your band is not ""punk."" And in the three and a half years this band was away, the scene changed, but their fan base remained intact and they should have stayed a little closer to home on this release rather than go running off into what the band calls ""unchartered musical territory.""

But when I had heard that they were going to do a remake of a classic movie song, I was honestly not impressed with what I had heard. In fact, it sounded much cheaper than when Ray Parker Jr. was accused of stealing from Huey Lewis & The News's hit I Want A New Drug back in the 80's. Fall Out Boy's version of the Ghostbusters (I'm Not Afraid) is honestly one of the cheapest remakes that sounds much worse than what I had first heard years ago. It is not only a poor remake, but definitely is one of those songs that you can easily say, ""Boy, did I waste my time on this song!""

This is rock music.  There is NOTHING on this CD that is in any way connected to country music.  Calling this country music shows a lack of both knowledge of and respect for country music and its rich history.

Like a lot of music that is put out and marketed as ""country"" (I'm looking at you Taylor Swift), this is what I like to call turkey bacon.  I'm sure everyone's had turkey bacon.  It's turkey flavored, cut, and cooked like bacon.  And turkey is great! I love turkey.  But cutting it and cooking it differently doesn't change the fact that it is turkey, not bacon.  Bacon is pork.

And this album is rock...not country.  The marketers and industry executives have tried to tell people differently, but there are those of us who love and respect country music enough not to fall for it.

None of this is to say rock is a bad thing.  Just like turkey, I like rock music.  Country is my favorite, but there's a lot of good rock music out there.  But FGL isn't even good rock music.  By all accounts, it's just terrible music altogether.  It's boring, unoriginal, unimaginative.

Honestly, take a good hard listen to the lyrics of ""Cruise."" And ""Get Your Shine On""?  Honestly?  This is the best this group has to offer.  It's things like this that have basically made listening to country radio unbearable.  While these two are busy making hits by singing about nothing, a duo that actually makes quality music (Halfway to Hazard) falls by the wayside.  I bet most FGL fans have never even heard of Jason Isbell.

This album is just more mass-produced garbage.  And the public eats it up and turns it into hits, guaranteeing that these two guys aren't going away anytime soon.

There are several songs that are not for children the main one is ""Birthday"" DO NOT buy this or let your children listen to this! There are some songs that are okay for children but NOT the whole album and definietly NOT the song caleld ""Birthday"" so if you hear your children listening to this stop it immediately, also do not let them listen to Teenage Dream almost ANY song other than Firework is very sexually explicit! The title track Teenage Dream, California Dreams, ET, Peacock, Last Friday Night are ALL sexually explicit and NO children should listen to those, if you let your children listen to those you are a horrible parent.

Now as for this album there is at least WAY WAY less sexuality...the only major sexual song is Birthday and the lyrics in the other songs are much better, but the major problem with this one is another problem Teenage Dream album had is that it forces way too much high pitched vocals that don't sound good because there's just way too many high pitched vocals in that song...luckily not all songs like are like that...but even the more decent songs are just completely generic and suffer from poor vocals...they're just not AS bad as the others but still not worth listening to. A lot of these songs are clearly influenced by if not directly copying many other songs so the originality is not there, even Roar is highly similar to several other songs including Eye of The Tiger by Survivor, plus the song This Moment copies what made Trapped in The Closet by R. Kelly famous there is no way that similarity was done on accident. Lack of originalty and too many repetitive bad sounding high pitched vocals ruin the majority of the album. Some bad lyrics. Cannot recommend the album has a whole despite the album not being all bad there are some decent [VERY generic] tracks but still not really worth listening to because there is WAY better music out there. This album and the artist themselves is FAKE. This artist never would have had a hit song if it weren't for buying her own radio airtime [confirmed by radio stations] and buying Youtube views [also confirmed by Youtube and VEVO] what ultimately makes these songs just horrible is just the fact of how horrible of a person Katy Perry is.

Unfortunately, Rihanna has been one of those washed-up singers who has been more like a robot in her voice, than really having anything that can match from the soul of the heart. Her latest set of songs has honestly been less than stellar in her voice, and it has shown to be more choppy and course, than elegant and intimate. Four Five Seconds, which she did with Paul McCartney and Kanye West really failed to deliver from the heart in every way. Bitch Better Have My Money, or BBHHM is honestly one of those songs that feels more whack than anything that really has delivered. I definitely think the song feels more like a waste of time, than sincerely a singer that knows she should be working it. I overall found the song to be one of her low points overall.

On several issues he seemed to have somewhat confused takes on things, leaving people to wonder what he meant. But on the matter of a woman being raped and then becoming pregnant which she then sought to terminate, he was unequivocal. Justin Bieber stated: ""Everything happens for a reason."" This was his way of explaining why he thought it was wrong for the woman to seek termination. Well, the bizarre theology which apparently this kid has been raised with is not the first issue. Even though it sounds more like pagan fatalism than any sort of Christianity. But that begs the question, which is closely related to the only point that really matters here: Are we now even beyond the idiot culture? Have we moved even a step further into the quicksand. Is our cultural vacancy now to be assumed  as pregnant with potential philosophy???  This can be shown phenomenologically by the fact that comparable stars of the past  like Leif Garret were not asked for their philosophical reflection.

Bruce Cockburn has not done it for me over the last several years.  His early work (up through ""Circles In The Stream"") has a sort of innocence to it.  It was filled with spiritual wonder and well crafted lyrics - poetic and insightful.  I lost interest from ""Circles"" until ""Stealing fire"" and ""World of Wonders"".  The CD ""Big Circumstance"" seemed to go back into his heavy political activism views.  His live CD was okay, but nothing like his first live CD ""Circles in the Stream"".  Then a jewel came along reviving Bruce as fresh and insightful again with ""Nothing but a burning light"".  Then came along a nice Christmas CD filled with unique arrangements, and then ""Dart to the Heart"". ""Nothing"" and ""Dart"" were fantastic.  Bruce seemed to back away from his political BS and back into spiritual songs, insightful lyrics, and songs filled with real meaning.  Bruce was back.  Then came Charity.  A pretty good CD but lacking a bit from ""Nothing"" & ""Dart"".  Then it went downhill.  ""Breakfast"" and ""You've never seen everything"" were musically good, but lyrically lackluster.  Kind of dull.  Then it got worse.  ""Life short"" was a dissapointment and a CD rarely listend to at all.  I thought it could not get any worse until ""Small source of comfort"" came out.  This is the first CD that is total trash and worthless.  Bruce has lost his mind, is alienating most everyone and appealing to the liberal left to the maximum.  Sometime I did not agree with some of Bruce's songs but I could undersand was coming from, or his view point.  I am open to other opnions and with music, you certainly have to be.  However, with ""Small source of comfort"" instead of love, spiritual, and political; the listener gets ALL political mumbo jumbo.  Yuck.  The music is not as good, Bruce's voice is not as strong, and most disappointing is the lyrical content.  The songs have no passion or insightful meaning, just quotable hate and low tolerance for anything other than those who preach tolerance but are the least tolerant of all.  I used to really enjoy Bruce Cockburn.  Wonder if the spiritual side will reawaken sometime in the near future?  Who knows, but ""Small Source of Comfort"" is awful.  I really tried to give it a fair shake by using the test of time.  I could not even listen to it when I got it so I put it away for a year and tried it again.  No such luck, it is just as awful today as when I first recevied it.  Can Bruce produce something worthy of listening to again?  He is so far left now that I do not know if he can pull himself back into some sort of normalcy.  Then again, I guess that is the trouble with the normal and I will just be waiting on a miracle.

A viable Southern hustling emcee of yesteryear, Paul Wall has made contributions to hip-hop through his records with the Swishahouse label and most recently with Paul Wall Music.

He is still that same on-the-grind hustler with expensive tastes, focused on staying on his toes and having fun in between time. Worthy of notable mention are the tracks ""No Favors,"" a lesson in self-reliance, and ""Codeine Heartbreak,"" where Wall discusses his love/hate relationship with extra strength, prescription cough syrup. The guest line-up is predictable, offering up verses of Dirty South flavor, especially from Screwed Up Click rapper Z-Ro, who appears twice on the album.

You see two old and one new compilations on the racks -- the much toted BEATLES 1 or the RED and BLUE ALBUMS respectively. Reasoning it out, you see both are double discs whereas BEATLES 1 is only a single disc. You want to know the sad part? BEATLES 1 is longer than both individually. Why? Because they want to stick to the original format supposedly. Yeah, whatever. I think its just to make more money off poor unsuspecting Beatles fans or people looking for an introduction to the greatest band in rock'n'roll history (you mean there are actually people who don't know The Beatles' entire body of work by heart?? For shame!) Both of them clock in about 70 minutes, whereas BEATLES 1 clocks in at just under 80 minutes. Either they need to do one of two things:

1. Expand the RED and BLUE albums to actual double albums and slap about 30 more songs to each collection (the White Album is woefully underrepresented, whereas seven of Magical Mystery Tour's 11 songs are on there).

2. Add 4 or 5 songs to each respectively, getting it as close to 80 minutes as you can, and slap them onto a double disc set. That way instead of buying 4 discs when only two are needed you get two discs.

""It has been a long and hard journey for the fledgling sound systems corporation, Weyland Sonics.
Industry insiders were shocked by the fatalities and property damage created by their first offering ""Taylor 1.2"".
Most considered this line as a complete write-off.

  The cost of repairing Houston's infrastructure alone was enough to make most corporations file for bankruptcy.
Undaunted, the new CEO of W.S., Charles Bleaufeldt, revamped their entire Research division. ""Youth, Youth, Youth!"" was the mantra for the
new CEO. ""We need sounds younger than Juice Newton, more strident than Ga-Ga 2.0 and lets keep the bio-covering as flat as possible!""

  His staff did complain and many resigned. One researcher, a Mr. Arno Stark, left to create his own tech company.
Mr Stark told me: ""Horrible, just horrible! By the time I left, I was drinking every day. The sound that thing made!
There is no ear protection made that can save you. Three techs were made permanently deaf! There is no controlling this thing!""

  Earlier this year, Mr. Bleaufeldt did unveil his new creation at the Branson Sound Technologies Expo.
He decided to change the name, from ""Taylor 3.4.5.2"" to the more appealing ""Taylor RED"".
Industry leaders were shocked by its ultra-thin bio-covering but were amazed by its speech emulation capacity. Here is a sample:
'Hi, I'm Taylor. I love the number 13. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*  I like imagining what life was like hundreds of years ago.
*whirrrrr-click-click-click* I have blurry eyesight. I'm easily excited, thrilled, scared, and shocked. *whirrrrr-click-click-click*
I live in Nashville, *whirrrrr-click-click-click*'

  Simply amazing! During Taylor-Red's debut it proved its effectiveness as a sonic weapon by disintegrating a 5 ton block of granite
from 20 feet away. Needless to say, the military was very impressed and rumors abound about the many orders they are placing.
Bleaufeldt is now considering building a miniature version of Taylor-Red for the European market.""","The ""Grand Experiment"" Cashes In..",1355875200,

1,28.0,False,"01 30, 2016",A1432KCCCZL550,B0189YO1GC,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Metalhammer,"I was really excited for this album.  After the self titled album I thought they'd found their way, but I was wrong. this sounds like a more piano driven version of something Geoff Tate would do except his vocals would be awful.  It has all the trademarks of his work over the past decade and a half; a bunch of ballads, slow uninteresting and forgettable music, no hooks, no particular tone nor emotional connection to the listener, no consideration as to what the fans would want to hear, bad lyrics.  I may be forgetting something but you get the idea.

Ok so what's wrong with this album?  Well for starters there's NOTHING memorable about this album.  It's seriously painful to try to listen to front to back when there's absolutely nothing catching my attention.  There are a bleep ton of ballads.  The album has to be a minimum of half ballads if not more.  Now look Dream Theater has some amazing ballads in their catalog, usually an exception rather than the rule especially once Kevin More left but still they've had some amazing ones, but none of these are on the same level as any of those classic songs and frankly they haven't written a great ballad in a long time, a couple decent ones over the past decade but none have been great.  Then there's the whole rock opera thing.  I guess that's a genre some people like but I absolutely hate it, though in fairness this is my first and it's exactly what I think of when I hear the term.  Another reviewer already stated some of this music sounds like Disney music and it so does especially the overly bubbly happy chorus to one of the few semi better constructed songs on disc 1, towards the end but I forget its name.

What happened to the song structures?  Dream Theater use to be a band that would give you an album of 7 to 9 songs clocking in at about 75 minutes.  I'll admit some of those songs could use some trimming especially on Train of Thought, but that's the style most fans have gotten use to, and there'd be something incredible on every album.  Not here.  We get a bunch of 3 and 4 minute, at most, songs with several 1 and 2 minute tracks thrown in there, and they don't even construct them properly.  Take a 3 1/2 minute song they'll have a 1 1/2 minute intro and leave about 2 minutes to dedicate to the actual song, if it ever gets going.

This album is also a heavily Jordan featured album.  I've said it before he's the worst thing to ever happen to Dream Theater.  I hate the man as a musician with everything that I am.  I'm tired of his circus music, boring piano pieces and nonsensical and unnecessary contributions to the band.  He was fine on Scenes from a Memory and hit and miss on 6 Degrees but he's been awful ever since.  I really hope these guys don't become the new 1999-2012 Queensryche cause while I enjoyed making fun of them it really came from a place of sadness, witnessing a once great band become a waste of anything involved in the making, producing and listening to  of any of their albums. I don't want that to become these guys.

Already this is the worst album of 2016 for me.  I don't care what else is released.  Already this year we've had albums by Megadeth-a good album, and Primal Fear-so so but better than this.  This thing is seriously so bad I listened to Kiss after, mother you know what KISS!!  That's how terible this is that anything Kiss has ever done, even their most silly cheesy uninteresting or over the top song is still better than this trash.  I would rather listen to In Flames's Siren Charms.  Yes it's an awful attempt at mainstream radio rock from a band that shouldn't attempt it but it had 2 good songs and wasn't 2 discs and over 30 tracks.  heck the bonus tracks were even ok.  Heck I'd rather listen to Q2k, Mindcrime 2, and American Soldier many times over before hearing this again.  Heck even Dedicated to chaos had 1 ok song.

There's absolutely nothing on here that's any good.  3 songs; A Better Life, A Life Left Behind and Moment Of Betrayal are ok as in if they were the weakest songs on an album of actual good songs they'd be worth listening enough that you wouldn't need to skip them.

Oh and this is really a John Petrucci solo album not a Dream Theater album, much like Q2k-Dedicated to chaos are Geoff Tate solo albums.  this isn't good and no one should ever have this in their collection for nay reason EVER.  But listen to it before you buy it. If you like it then by all means get it but be sure to listen to the whole thing first.

Oh and Def Leppard's self titled album is also better which is just sad.  If you want a good prog metal album pick up anything by Symphony X especially their 2 most recent albums.  Now that's a band that can show off their talent and write good songs.

In closing this album makes me angry.  It shouldn't I suppose but it does.  This is one of the worst albums I've ever heard a band I like put out and I won't support this garbage.",Is Geoff Tate involved in this somehow?,1454112000,

The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.

So if you don't agree with this, do not read any further. It is true that they appeared at a time which was a low ebb for rock in general. But it was mainly their looks and attitude that made the impact. Their recorded output has been pretty small and of irregular quality. Even Is This It is not a masterpiece. Their recorded output has been marred by a sloppy sludgy sound and missing bite iin thier attitude. This impression of boredom also permeates the first solo record by Julian Casablancas. The cover of the record is ultra-weird, with all these red colors additionally to the HMV dog (what's his name again) together with a phonograph: he is on EMI, get it? Julian Casablancas also stares blankly at us and the record conveys this blank impression. As I wrote the production is not good and the sound really muddy. He has added keyboards this time (on french TV he had a pretty keyboard player at least) but they can barely be hard to great effect. Also there are no real tunes and he sounds bored.

I was a bit surprised to see that this MP3 album's track listing on its Amazon web page does not show the performing artists' names on well over half the listed tracks, and the few names that are shown I have never heard of before. I thought it best to give this album a ""try-before-I-buy"" listen before committing even a couple of bucks to its purchase. I am glad I did.

This may be the worst compilation of music by Johann Sebastian Bach I have ever heard. The 100 tracks selected for this album are alright, although they only cover 25 different Bach compositions and therefore don't give a particularly well-rounded picture of the immense depth and breadth of Bach's incredible genius. The biggest problem, however, is the dated musicianship on the album.

Every one of the selections is played too slowly, and every performance is flat, lifeless, and dull. Allegro (quick) movements, especially in the Brandenburg Concerto, Orchestral Suite, piano concerto, and violin concerto selections, are played at a nearly Andante (moderately slow) pace, and Andante movements are played at close to a Largo (very slow) tempo.  Choral pieces fare no better. Choruses and solo vocalists, while technically competent, sing with little of the artistry  found in the best Bach recordings. I found the selections from both the ""St. Matthew Passion"" and St. John Passion"" especially lethargic and monotonous.

There are far better compilations of Bach's music that are performed by world-class musicians who infuse their performances with energy, passion, and tremendous artistry. Two such particularly praiseworthy albums are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essential-Bach-2CDs/dp/B000W0B1CO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essential Bach (2CDs)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-x-Bach/dp/B00P3CEUXS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 x Bach</a>, both of which are highly enjoyable and very affordable.

Music is very subjective. We all have different taste . There is no need for all the rudeness here .

I m a ""regular fan"" of Rihanna . I love her energy. I love her voice and let's say it ,this girl is drop dead gorgeous and have a stunning body. At 28 years old she looks more beautiful than ever . She is also very talented , an amazing dancer ( also amazing twerker) and has a truly beautiful voice . I ve been a fan of Rihanna since her debut and been listing to her music , going to her lives since than .

Sadly this is the one album from Rihanna i simply can't stand . TO ME  it felt more weak than her past albums ( maybe because i m used to her ""older ""stuff)
The music , the vibe was very slow and it felt like 16 tracks was simply unnecessary .

I was expecting something with more beat .

I am unsure if this album will be a turn in her career and she is trying to change from her ""classic style"" / rihanna signature  or if she is simply experimenting something new.
Also unsure if she put something out there because her contract said she had to . To me it simply lacked rihanna imprint on it

This album is a hit or miss depending the person. It at the complete oppositite of her past songs , music , vibes and style. I m glad some people enjoy it . I personally didn't . Its the first album i won't be listing to again .",a very slow album for me,1468108800,

I know Brantley Gilbert penned this song because of the tragic death of a soldier, and that makes a song worth serious attention, but there are tons of other country songs out there regarding fallen soldiers or soldiers in general out there and much more emotional and heart-felt than this song. I don't mind Brantley Gilbert making a song about the undeserved death of a soldier, since most of his material released as singles is either mediocre or absolutely horrible (I give 'Bottoms Up' credit for at least being catchy even though there are things about it that I don't like), but trying to express the emotion of th death of a loved one in a song, and then using the most trite, horrid, and annoying high-pitched guitar solos all over the song make the person the song is about ashamed. In fact, this is worse than what Gilbert has put out with any of his other singles. At least songs like 'Read Me My Rights' & 'Stone Cold Sober' show that Gilbert is making music correctly even though the instrumental elements of the songs may not be done well.

But, when Radio Stations fumble with what gets played on the radio, and then choose a very annoying and terrible song to play, thats what should be abolished for eternity.  Even worse is when they play a bad song ad nauseum, you predict they probably won't play a song that much to elavate your anger, but they do anyway, no matter how you feel about the song, and it never stops until you start hating the song with a passion, and THEN they start to cool down with that song. Instead of just stopping with the song right when you feel like they need to stop. That is a method in radio, not just country, that needs to be abolished from reality for eternity.

We need a Brantley Gilbert song that isn't so boring, bland, trite, or not what you want to repeat on Spotify. His new single isn't helping because besides the country pop and rock stuff that you saw in 'Bottoms Up', Gilbert ends up using some of the worst cliches and overused phrases. Instead of thinking to yourself 'Finally, a song from this guy I can actually tolerate beyond chart movement', its always the same feelings about a whole new song all over again.

Man the top 40 is the biggest joke EVER. Especially when it comes to these top 40 playing stations, who avoid the good music that reaches the charts once in a blue moon, and just plays this sort of rubbish, just because they are all paid to.

This particular song here is not a song. I don't care what kind of message it is portraying, a million other songs out there have messages and meanings too, so don't even for one second try to tell me this is unique or special. Just about every other artist out there writes lyrics from the heart, and have a soulful meaning, so quit thinking this one here is the only song that has ever been written to do so. Did I say song? I meant, this guy talking his lyrics out. There is no melody, no soul, no fun, and definitely no talent. At least artists who do these kind of things in the past added a rhythm, or a beat to it to keep it from sounding like a E-book with background sounds. Beck didn't bore you to death like this when they spoke out the lyrics, and at least they added a melodic chorus and showed they where musicians, unlike this guy who if he read this so called ""inspirational"" poem out without the trickery that it is a song, he would be booed off stage for someone else to come on and wake the rest of the audience up.

The vocals are just irritating, but who knows, maybe I could stand this song had it not been preformed by these untalented artists. They knew the song was so damn boring and they can't add melody because they can't sing, so they got Mary Lambert to come in and throw down whatever POS she could come up with to disguise this spoke words as a song. Hat's off to her for not using an auto-tuner, otherwise I would slam her down too, who ever she is, but even her lyrics and actual melody in this horrible song is not enough to make it worthy of 1 star.","What an annoying, no talent, POS this is.",1358812800,

If that's the case, then I think Coheed should go back to ripping off Rush and Iron Maiden.

Coheed are very talented, and frustratingly so. If anything, the first two albums are two of the greatest achievements in Prog Rock if you ask me. Then their third album came ad it was somewhat quite middling. A lot of good on there, a lot of decent, a lot of bad. Then the fourth, No World For Tomorrow... I don't think there were any memorable tunes on that disc. OK, I Liked the title track and Gravediggers and Gunslingers. And On The Brink was good too.

Well, with this album, Josh is gone. In comes Chris Pennie, an extraordinarily talented drummer. A nice bloke too, I met him back in October. Also returning is the lack of any memorable songs. None of the tunes on this disc would rate above a 2/5.

I actually don't like any of the songs of this disc. As I stated, the highest I can give any of the songs is a 2/5. Every track feels out of place in the cotext of the one before it. The only tune on this disc that sounds like it fits on a Coheed disc is When Skeletons Live, and even that track sounds out of place, like they had to rush in a track that sounds like old Coheed. The best tune on the album, This Shattered Symphony, Has an amazing opening and chorus, but is ruined by a totally lame part before the chorus. Same thing with Guns of Summer, despite the awesome drumming. The Broken starts off awesome but quickly falls flat on it's face. World of Lines sounds like they took the boring parts of No Prayer For The Dying, and threw them into one song.

I can't even stomach Here We Are Juggernaut, with the chorus being amazing and everything else being cringe worthy. The intro to In The Flame of Error and the chorus rule but everything else is ruined by what ruins the whole album- Coheed having interesting parts of songs, then suddenly going off into a wild tangent. Hence the ""pretentious"" part. They're trying too hard.

Then of course, what should be The highlight ofthe album is actually their worst song EVER, and may even be one of the worst songs I've ever heard. It is essentially just noodling around for 7 minutes. Not even the bizarre and creepy coda at the end could redeem it. Here's the thing guys. I love heavy metal. I love electronica. I love Prog. I don't love it when a band forces everything into a Blender at once, thus creating a pretentious mix that is as cringe worthy as it gets.

Also, the lyrics are disastrous. I remember when their lyrics not only told a story but were very painful and had you relating. Here they've clearly taken a step back in that department. ""Rain down fire and BUUUUUUURN US AAAAAAALLLLLLLLL!!!!!!!"" ugh, seriously? I am all for angry lyrics but this is just stupid.

Look, Coheed are much better than this. They have TALENT. They can actually write tunes. They can explore their creativity in ways no other modern band can. But this album just bores me. I sincerely hope they can make a comeback with their next disc.",Easily the worst thing I've ever heard from Coheed,1271116800,

She has been so overexposed, and yet she still needs to really find her voice. Her latest song, Birthday Cake from Talk That Talk was really short absolutely disgraceful from start to finish. Not only is it terrible and short, but what really gets me angry is the remix of her song, as she collaborates with the man whom had assaulted her and abused her at The Grammy awards 3 years ago, Chris Brown. It definitely has wasted Rihanna's credibility away as a performer by a lot, and when I said she really needs to find her voice, she definitely doesn't feel like she has one anymore. Maybe, Rihanna should just go away for a long while, then come back as a real singer.

It's not even a matter of the music being pathetically basic (it's a contingent relationship rather than a necessary one) -- the music is just flat-out crappy.

That might not be a bad thing, if she didn't sound even WORSE without it than with it. This proves that her ability as a singer is very limited at best, as is the case with all the other mainstream sound-alikes we have being produced just to make money off the masses. I will not blindly blame Kesha for 100% of this typical, generic-sounding, cookie-cutter dung heap; The majority of the blame goes to that loser known as Dr. Luke, who produces a handful of the other mainstream sound-alike puppets.

But it's not an unconditional love -- the loathing I have for ""Jonah Hex"" proves it. This movie is a bit like the evil love child of ""Wild Wild West"" and ""Van Helsing,"" with all the bloodcurdling stupidity of the former and the flashy steampunky trappings of the latter. Josh Brolin does his best to salvage this messy undercooked stew of cliches, but honestly... there's no saving this movie.

Jonah Hex (Brolin) was a Confederate soldier who turned against his commander Quentin Turnbull (John Malkovich), and Turnbull got his revenge by killing Hex's family, scarring his face and leaving him for dead on a cross. Of course he doesn't die, but becomes a bounty hunter who can communicate with the dead just by touching them. All this is crammed in the first three minutes.

Then the president recruits him to hunt down Turnbull, who is building ""the weapon"" that could destroy the entire United States. So he meanders off and brawls with some people, gets some crossbow-guns (what?), and rushes to rescue his favorite hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold (is there any other kind in movies?).

I wish I could give a better summary of the plot in ""Jonah Hex,"" but that's kind of like examining the acting talent displayed by Megan Fox -- it's so minimal that you'll just sprain your brain if you try to actually talk about it. Jonah is traumatized, he shoots people, he gets drafted, he shoots people, he goes searching for Turnbull, he shoots people, and so on and so forth.

Basically there's not much plot here, so the writers pad it with as many fiery explosions, gunfights and hallucinatory flashbacks as they possibly can. The dialogue is leaden (""Ain't mah country. Git lost or git dead""), and all the dramatic twists are painfully predictable. As for ""the weapon,"" it is quite possibly the silliest superweapon I have EVER seen in a movie, short of a giant slingshot. THIS is supposed to be able to bring down a budding superpower?

I'll give Brolin credit, he does what he can, and he slurs and grinds around his fake facial deformity with convincing grittiness. The problem is, his character's backstory is so hastily slapped together that it's hard to care -- I mean, it's sad that his family died, but we barely even SAW them and don't see much of how he felt. Megan Fox is all flat drawling and vacuous stares, but fortunately she only has a few scenes. During the more dramatic moments you can almost see smoke coming out of her ears.

""Jonah Hex"" is all wasted potential -- it has pretty much no plot, not much decent acting, and an ending worthy of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000."" Give it a pass.",Put a hex on it,1298937600,

I could blather on about how great Josh's voice is, how heartfelt and profound his compositions are, the angst of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this turd of a CD.  The Grobanites posting the orgasmic reviews of this CD are either doing so out of misguided love and loyalty for their curly haired cutie pie or they are simply deaf.

I'm not one to expect any artist to sing the same old stuff album after album.  Josh definitely stretched his singing chops with the work he did with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo and the cool, hip, jazz piece ""Machine"" all from Closer.  Now that was cool.  It wasn't the same old Power Ballads that made him famous or the Foster Sugar Schlock.  But Illuminations makes it difficult to believe that Josh spent five years slaving over musical compositions and arrangements and the best he could come up with was this piece of crap.  What's even more ballsy is the price of the ""Internet Edition"" he's selling on his exclusive fan club.  $39.99 for this plus two additional digital downloads.  And why not?  The four to five star reviews posted just here proves that he can clear his throat and his devoted Grobanites will applaud him.

What this album sounds like is that Josh goofed off for five years and told his fans he was slaving over the bestest-ever-in-the-world-CD-just-for-them and he knows they're stupid enough to believe him.  At the last minute, he moves to New York, putters about and then pukes up some whining, whinging, angst-ridden, lonely-in-New-York-looking-for-love pabulum that only Grobanites find palatable.

How funny is this, I downloaded this a few days before it was offered in the 25 Days Of Free thinking it seemed very odd for Lady GaGa to be doing ""O Christmas Tree"" but I also downloaded a bunch of other stuff at the same time that I was in a bigger hurry to listen to.  Then I got so wrapped up in protesting the listing of ""Slower Than Christmas"" that I didn't even take the time to look at the reviews this song was getting until today's offering of Badd Santa ""Christmas Girl"".  I hadn't even listened to it until today.  Surprise surprise, it isn't ""O Christmas Tree"" after all, but a song that makes sexual metaphors out of Christmas trees (and female metaphors at that, figure that one out).

Setting the gross inappropriateness of this song aside for a moment, this is a weak song musically.  If I'm not mistaken, there are two lines in the entire song, maybe three.  It makes a strange shift in the middle to Space Cowboy rapping the same line, then shifts back to GaGa, and then finishes with one of my big pet peeves, a self reference (and a double one at that)!  The backing music is a choppy, repetitive bed of electronic harmony which has nothing exciting to offer.  The only thing this song brings to the table is overt sexuality.  Coming from a former burlesque dancer, this seems no surprise.  That Amazon wants to advertise it as part of the 25 Days Of Free would be surprising if it weren't a part of a disturbing trend this year.

Amazon is trying very hard to push the ""edgy"" envelope and it is leaving a lot of us scratching our heads.  I think it would be more understandable if the edgy songs in question were particularly good, but they aren't.  This song brought to mind a song they sometimes play on Bob and Tom about Santa going to town, only that song is FUNNY, this isn't.

This song is blatantly irresponsible in that it is targeted at pop music buyers.  The age bracket for pop music buyers is 12(ish) to 25.  The upper range of that bracket I have no issue with, but this includes middle school kids.  Singing this kind of innuendo to middle schoolers is just plain wrong.  With the setup of getting this song off a Christmas recommendation list and an innocuous title that can easily be mistaken for an age old Christmas carol, I'm sure this will lead to many kids getting their hands on this right under their parents' unsuspecting noses.

Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own ""Bells and Whistles"" to stand out from the rest. So on to ""Stabbing the Drama"" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of ""Stabbing the Drama"" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic.

If you read them, they are almost word for word the same, so someone's doing a killer job with their PR.  It's as if no one dares to speak badly about elder statesmen.  And so those who assume I'm a fair-weather fan, I've purchased everything the band and solo artists have put out since 1973.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious about their four song Ep.  What had a ten year absence brought (after a 16 year one before that)?  Well, not much - that's for sure.

First off, any Fleetwood Mac album since 1987 has been a result of Lindsey Buckingham's solo work being taken and morphed into a Fleetwood Mac album - and it always shows.  'Extended Play' is no different.

Three of the four are Buckingham tunes - and iffy ones at that.  The one Stevie Nicks song is from 1973 - which isn't a shock. Almost all her material for the last 25 years has been pulled songs she wrote in the '70s.  If they weren't good enough to record then.......guess what?

Let's start with her ""Without You"".  Cat Stevens should sue for plagiarism.  The music and arrangement has ""Peace Train"" written all over it.  (and enough with finding these songs on YouTube, which she did on her last solo disk, and from a woman who claims not to own or use a computer.)

The criticism of Nicks' voice back in the '70s was somewhat unwarranted, but like a prophecy waiting to be fulfilled, she lived up to it long ago.

Nicks' voice has been shot since the late '80's and for the life of me, the people who trip over themselves to sing (ha!) her praises is beyond me. The woman can no longer sing more than three notes and it is painful to listen to - mostly due to the nostalgia I'm feeling of what used to be.  Her vocal limits can work when songs and vocals are arranged correctly. But I can think of a few instances in the last 20 years where that has worked. It didn't hurt that the harmony vocals helped save those few songs.  For this outing, the harmonies are barely there....and they're all hers.

Buckingham's ""Sad Angel"" is just half right. It's sad.  I don't know it would have even worked as a solo song, but it doesn't pass muster as a band one.  And speaking of solo stuff, his ""It Takes Time"" is just that.  Seriously, if you're going to do a group record, then a song with just you and a piano isn't the one to present in this venue. Save it for your solo work.

The only song that pseudo-works is the horribly titled ""Miss Fantasy"".  Buckingham writes notes he can't possibly hit - and doesn't - but doesn't jigger the vocal arrangement.  It is here that Nick's muted harmony on the chorus actually (almost) saves the song.

What is sadder than the actual release is the band's assertion that this is some of their best work.  Yikes.

I get that they're 63 years old and up, but has their hearing gone too?

I'm not sure whether to blame Buckingham or co-producer Mitchell Froom.  Froom was a wiz with Crowded House, Forest for the Trees and Suzanne Vega.  But he bombs out here.  Or maybe this is the best he could do with which he had to work.

I expect more from a band like this and not be expected to take with gratitude anything they push our way once every decade. They don't just get a pass. Either way - skip it.  Save yourself $3.98.",What No Reviewer Will Say,1369008000,

When they try to change things up they basically put movie trailer music as the intro to an overly long song ""We Walk Without Fear"" and call that progress.  I mean seriously I expected to hear the movie trailer guy talking over it saying things like ""Coming..  July.. 31st..  Get.. Ready..  For..  Action"" followed by a list of actors or some variation.  I don't think they do those trailers anymore actually.

I'm not saying Primal Fear needs to be anything other than what they are.  Sure some experimentation would be nice, but they don't have to stop being a power metal band or anything, but they need to stop using the same riffs, melodies, and drum beats and try to write something that's actually good.  But this will please the people who only want the same stuff over and over and don't care if a band puts effort into creating a good album or releases another stale boring release.  I like these guys I really do.  I like most songs on all of their albums from the self titled through Unbreakable, but I feel they've gotten too comfortable and no one, no producers and certainly not the fans, are pushing them to do better.",Nothing but fillers,1467331200,

I thought since he was working with Dr. Dre that maybe Dre had picked up on someone that had some talent and could give us a solid hip-hop artist. I was dead wrong. WHen this CD was first released, I didn't think it was terrible, but the more it got overplayed, and the more nosense I heard about 50, the less appealing the CD became to me. It is apparent that 50 was a creation of some money hungry record label that probely got ahold of Dre (thank Interscope Records) and asked him if he could sign on with him and be part of his Aftermath label. What a joke, not only is 50 probely the least think from a ganster, he is a total sell out. I love how he hangs in Beverly Hills Spa's and Star Magazine parties. Sure he is a ganasta alright. Does anyone really believe that this guy was shot 9 times. I bet you his real name is Erkel and he proebely grew up some posh suburban community and got stuffed into lockers in high-school. Shame on you Dre for putting this dope on your record label, and shame on Interscope for pressuring you into signing him. DO I have proof that this happened?

Her latest set of songs just haven't set the benchmark as a real songstress. Bitch Better Have My Money or BBHMM, her latest song is absolutely pathetic and poorly done. She tries and changes her game and be more street, and instead her spirit in voice has diminished at the heart of the matter.

Like it or not that's what they are and you can't deny that.

I actually quite enjoyed their 2012 release, again don't remember the name of it.  But this garbage?

this whole album sounds like a modern Disciple album without the Jesus lyrics, and I'm not exaggerating.  From the moment I heard the first song I thought ""Disciple called.  They want their music back"".  But what can I expect froma  band who ripped themselves off on the awful 09 release, remaking ""I devise my own demise"" forget the name of the horrific carbon copy track but that was the original song's title.  There's no edge at all to the music.  It's so generic it'll make your ears bleed.  Like I said going into an album by this band you have to expect a certain level of this, but geez this is too much.  We get silly rapping, bad electronic bits and guest rappers ruining what could have been a mildly tolerable song.

And most of these 5 star reviews must be put out by the band  I mean seriously I can't imagine people honestly believing this is amongst the best albums of all time.  Where are the voices of reason?  The 2-4 star reviews.  Hell the 1 star review before mine was obviously a troll.  I at least like some of this band's past work.  I mean I can honestly believe people out there like this, but a perfect score at such a rate?  Not even close.  This is no Dark side of the moon.  No Led Zeppelin 4.  No White Album.  Hell it's not even Ten.  It's just a silly band trying to stay relevant by creating an album to appeal to teenagers.  If not for the awful work Billy Corgan has been doing since re-creating the Pumpkins I'd say this is the worst album I've heard in the past decade.

1,24.0,False,"03 20, 2014",A3H7HYC9HIQAAQ,B00IAR2DNM,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Jon Broxton,"Once upon a time there was a director who, along with some friends - a writer, a cameraman, some actors - made a movie. It doesn't matter what the movie was about. It could have been about aliens, or cowboys and indians, or a young couple suffering through a rocky relationship, or a bank robbery gone wrong. Whatever it was about, the director wanted to make the best movie he could make, and for the audience who saw that movie to care about the characters, and to empathize with the emotions they felt. At some point, he approached a composer, in order to give that film a musical voice. The composer - who was well-versed in musical theory and composition - was as much of a storyteller as the director was, and wanted to enhance the film with his music; to bring out subtle emotions so the audience could feel them, to highlight subtexts that acting alone could not convey, to make it a better film than it would be without the music being there.

The director and composer decided what sort of music was needed, and how much, and then the composer went away and wrote: he wrote music which was specific to that film, tailored to those scenes, and those characters. His score gave the film an identity, with an overarching structure, recurring thematic ideas and musical reference points that drew characters, concepts and locations together, so that they felt like a part of the fully realized world the movie inhabited. He poured all his knowledge and craft into the score, making it interesting and compelling from a musical point of view, while simultaneously serving the drama on-screen. He made the action more exciting. The made the horror scarier. He made the relationships more romantic. He made the tension so tense you would bite your fingernails to the quick. Of course, the composer would have a musical style of his own, and once in a while a certain way of phrasing an instrument, or the way a chord progressed, would relate back to something else that same composer wrote before, but that's inevitable when a composer writes as much personal music as a film composer does, and would not detract much from the new work. The composer then recorded that score, using the finest musicians he could find, bringing all that talent and experience to bear on the music. The resulting work was a perfect marriage of pictures and sound, with music that was memorable, musically compelling, interesting and complex, dramatically appropriate, emotionally powerful, and crafted solely to serve that film and no other. This approach was so successful that everyone decided that this should henceforth be the way films should be scored, and everyone lived happily ever after. The end.

Except that it's not the end, because brothers Anthony Russo and Joe Russo decided that, when it came to their film Captain America: The Winter Soldier, they would ignore all of that and ask composer Henry Jackman to write one of the most grating, themeless, emotionally barren scores I have had the misfortune of hearing in several years. The words ""clichd"" and ""generic"" could have been invented specifically for this score, which takes all the worst aspects of modern film scoring and amplifies them a hundred fold, reveling in their lack of coherent musical ideas, individual identities, and musical inventiveness. In these circumstances I would usually break out my `polar bear with a migraine' photo and leave it to speak for itself, but my friend and colleague James Southall's excellent review of this score made me want to make some points of my own.

The film itself is apparently very good; more of a political thriller than a super-hero movie, it picks up Captain America's story two years after the events of The Avengers. Now living in Washington DC and struggling to adjust to life in the 21st century, the Captain himself Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) finds himself thrust back into action when a SHIELD operative is attacked by a mysterious assassin known as the Winter Soldier, whose exploits date back to the cold war. Teaming up with fellow super-heroes Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Falcon (Anthony Mackie), Captain America must uncover the mystery surrounding the Winter Soldier's identity, and stop the threat he poses to the world. The film has a fantastic supporting cast, including Robert Redford, Sebastian Stan, Frank Grillo, Emily Van Camp, and Marvel Universe regulars Samuel L. Jackson, Colbie Smulders and Dominic Cooper, and looks set to be one of 2014's most successful films.

In musical terms, however, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is an absolute disaster. The Marvel Universe films have always been a bit hit or miss when it comes to their scores, with little to no musical continuity between them, and a revolving roster of composers ranging from Ramin Djawadi to Patrick Doyle to Brian Tyler. Alan Silvestri's score for the first Captain America film was excellent, filled with all the things I talk about in my opening paragraphs, and - best of all - containing a rousing, memorable theme for Captain America himself. Sadly, Winter Soldier's composer Henry Jackman ignores everything Silvestri did, instead composing a more `modern' score which emphasizes sound design and electronic textures over anything resembling actual music. I hate writing paragraphs like this, because historically I have liked Henry Jackman's work a great deal. It's astonishing to me that a composer who can craft such wonderful scores as Gulliver's Travels, Puss in Boots or Wreck-It Ralph could turn around and write something as obnoxious as this.

There is a new theme for Captain America - a bit of martial heroism for brass and snare drums introduced in ""Project Insight"" - although why Jackman decided not to use Silvestri's established theme for the character is beyond me, especially when Brian Tyler even quoted it in Thor 2. There's a bit of warm Americana which appears in the brief ""The Smithsonian"". And that's about it, in terms of positive things I can say about this score. Probably the worst aspect of Jackman's score is that, for the most part, it's not even made up of his own ideas. For example the opening track, ""Lemurian Star"", is little more than a combination of Hans Zimmer's now-ubiquitous extended brass note from Inception, John Powell's synthy action rhythms from the Bourne series. Similarly, the big action set pieces which come later - ""Taking a Stand"", ""Into the Fray"" and ""Countdown: for example - have moments of power and grandeur, but have no real individual identity. Despite a couple of them containing repeat performances of the new Captain America theme from ""Project Insight"", nothing about them ever really says `this is music for Captain America'. Jackman's theme is so nondescript, it could be from any superhero or action movie from the past 20 years, and the action rhythms and percussive patterns Jackman employs sound like all the other action rhythms and percussive patterns everyone from Hans Zimmer down has used for the past decade.

At the other end of the scale cues like ""An Old Friend"", ""Alexander Pierce"", ""Frozen in Time"" and ""Natasha"" are quieter but say nothing; they just meander along for a couple of minutes, presenting muted orchestral textures, string sustains, serious timpani rumbles. Unobtrusive, understated, but completely inert in terms of anything resembling musical development.

Worst of all are cues like ""Fury"", the truly awful ""The Winter Soldier"", ""Fallen"", ""Hydra"" and ""The Causeway"", which are simply appalling: little more than exercises in repeated string rhythms and loops overlaid by various banging and clanging industrial sound effects, and groaning electronic textures. Both ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""The Causeway"" contain what sounds like a processed scream as part of the electronic sound mix, and which appears to be an attempt at a leitmotif for the Winter Soldier character himself; when I first heard it I had to stop and check that it wasn't my own screams I could hear over my headphones.

I have been around the film music industry for a long time now - almost 20 years. I have attended scoring sessions, and attended lectures and seminars on the art. I have met pretty much every major composer working in Hollywood today, and I consider many of them friends. I understand fully that the demands put upon a film composer's shoulders are enormous, ranging from ever-decreasing budgets and ever-decreasing timescales to having to deal with temp tracks, focus groups, musically illiterate directors, and boardrooms full of producers who all want to have their say about how the music should sound. Long gone are the days where one director and one composer would work together to craft their musical vision of a film, as in my rose-tinted once-upon-a-time story that opened this review. Truthfully, I'm not sure my idyllic fairytale of the film score world was ever what it was truly like. In many ways, you can't blame Henry Jackman for giving his employers exactly what they wanted: that's his job, after all. But, still, there has to be a way to write a score which fulfills all the demands set by the no-nothing money men, but doesn't strip away all the emotion, doesn't pander to the common denominator, and still manages to contain some semblance of identity, uniqueness, and inventiveness for both the composer and the film. There has to be a way.",There has to be a better way,1395273600,

I thought music had hit its low with BEP's musical brain aneurysm ""Boom Boom Pow"". I can autotune myself vomiting and that would be a better song. But then I heard this song.

I looked it up on a lyrics site and was startled at what I read- 12 people wrote this song. Actually I'm amazed. It took 12 people to write lyrics like:

""I've gotta feeling
that tonight's gonna be a good night
that tonight's gonna be a good night
that tonight's gonna be a good, good night""
Which is repeated for roughly 90 seconds before the song even starts. How about:

""Tonight's the night, let's live it up
I got my money, let's spend it up"" (yeah, rhyming ""Up"" and ""up"")

""Monday, tuesday, wednesday and thursday, friday, saturday, saturday to sunday,
Get get get get get with us, you know what we say-say, party every day
pppparty every day"" (We know what the days of the week are. Party every day???)

Or what about the fact that ""That tonight's gonna be a good night"" is repeated 18 times, ""Do it"" is repeated 31 times, or the random use of ""Mazel tov"" or ""L'chiam"" (Is this that movie ""When The Wind Blows"" on acid? ""When the BEP Blows""?)???

Yeah the beat is pretty catchy, you gotta admit. Though it's catchy the first time you hear it, and then the next 500 times you hear it makes you wanna find the nearest object that can be used as a weapon, and find some way
to use it as means of killing yourself. I'd say ""Avoid"" but since this drivel is played roughly every 10 minutes, it's really unavoidable.

1,5.0,True,"01 6, 2013",A2L8BDAEFRPOC,B00AJRP4FU,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},G. Miller,"I just finished downloading (from the cloud) and there's a problem.  Four of the tracks will not play on Windows Media Player or on Winamp (on a Windows XP system).
The bad tracks are:
 (disc 1) track 04
 (disc 1) track 08
 (disc 2) track 10
 (disc 2) track 13
If I try to open them in Windows Media Player, nothing happens; the name doesn't even appear in the playlist.
If I try to open them in Winamp, then (disc 1) track 01 (Canon) plays instead!

I believe that the problem is caused by the file name/path being too long.  Windows won't even let you rename them in the normal way.

UPDATE: I've found a workaround to the file problem, which is listed at the end of this review.*

ALSO:  Several of the tracks are NOT relaxing, IMHO.  For example, disc 1 track 9 (Violin Sonata) has several passages that become quite loud and full of angst...  not relaxing to me.  Disc 2 track 4 (Ballade No. 1) has several sections that are quite loud and heavy-handed, and a section near the end that is quite agitated.  Disc 2 track 10 (Sonata for Two Pianos) begins quietly, but has several passages that become quite loud and aggressive.  Disc 2 track 16 (Minuet in G) has a few sections that are downright bombastic, with the piano hammering out the bass line in octaves while the orchestra plays fortissimo.

Indeed, classical music is not necessarily intended to be soporific.  But the selection on this pair of MP3 ""discs"" seems to be quite erratic.  To point out just one glaring example:  where is Brahms' Lullabye?

Buy this as a general sampler, if you like.  But do NOT expect to be relaxed and lulled to sleep when it's finished.

* FILE REPAIR SOLUTION

As I suspected, the problem is the excessive length of the file name and ""path"" (the entire route that the computer takes to get to the files).  Windows allows a maximum of 255 characters for the path + name.

By default, when you download these, Amazon will put them in this path:
C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Documents\Amazon\Various Artists\A Collection of the Most Relaxing Classical Music in the Universe\
That's 135 characters right there, which leaves 120 characters for the track name.

Now let's consider the name of one of the non-functional files:
(disc 2) 10 - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_ - Sonata for Two Pianos in F minor, Op. 34b_ II. Andante, _un poco adagio_.mp3
That's 165 characters.  So the total is 135 + 165 = 300 characters, well over the 255-character limit.  Windows just can't handle that!

As a workaround, after you have downloaded all the files, navigate to the folder as listed above.  Temporarily rename the folder something very short, like ""XYZ"" (without the quotation marks).  That's 65 characters shorter than the original file name.  Now the totals are under 255 characters, so Windows will let you rename the individual files.  Go through and chop out all the duplicate information.  In the example given above, you'll cut out 72 characters, leaving a total of 93 characters.  Do this for all the tracks.

Finally, if you want, you can go back and rename the folder to something reasonable, like ""Relaxing Classical Music"" which will give you a total length of 94 characters.  If you add the new file name (from the example above) which is 93 characters, you'll see that you end up with a total of 187 characters, well UNDER the 255 character limit.

Of course one wonders:  Why didn't Amazon think about this, and use a reasonable album name, and file names WITHOUT duplication, in the first place.

MY CONCLUSION:  Given that at least four of the tracks are NOT relaxing, and you'll have to spend at least 15 minutes screwing around to fix the file naming errors, IMHO this collection just isn't worth the trouble, even if it's free to begin with.  Of course if you're really hard up for music that is MAYBE relaxing... go for it.

Personally, I think Amazon could and should do a better job.  I know I would, if I worked for them.",BEWARE!  4 tracks will not play!  Some others are NOT relaxing.,1357430400,

Did your ears first meet Iggy in 1969 as I did, was it 1973, or was it in 1977, when a song about a passenger sent your fingers rushing to dial the radio station to see who was singing.

Ive lived nearly my whole life with Iggy, Ive lived nearly my whole life attempting to like his music, his theater, his character, and his vision.  Yet after all this time I still find Iggy Pop to be nothing more than a novelty, with a mere handful of songs that I enjoy.  So why in the world would I think that Post Pop Depression, especially claiming it as his swan song, complete with Queens of the Stone Age in tow, would be any more, or any different.

People would like to tell you that theres something raw and hedonistic about Iggy Pop, and for mere moments thats true ... but those moments come on fast and and are just as fleeting.  Here we are, stepping into the 21st century, and Iggy Pop is attempting to doing the same old shtick he did in the latter half of the 20th century, and doing it not nearly as well.  Post Pop Depression is not something I even care about, much less hold dear to my heart, praising the powers that be, thrilled and saddened in the same moment that Im holding a new Iggy Pop album in my hands, and knowing it will be the last.

Most music rags are afraid to tell you they don't like the album for whatever reason ... but Im not.  MOJO gave it page after page and talked only about the secret nature of the release and Iggys Rolls Royce.  Rolling Stone talked endlessly about the old Iggy and his emergence with the Stooges.  Iggy tells us that he likes the songs, and so do some of his friends; though he says it in a less than convincing manner.  Make no mistake about it, Post Pop Depression is not bad because its the music of an old man, its also not bad because of its association with Queens of the Stone Age ... its just bad because its a grouping of songs presented in a manner thats irrelevant.  If Iggy had one thing going for him, it was that he was a one trick pony and you always knew what you were gonna get.  But this, this is Iggy trying to be relevant, and failing utterly.  He might have well recorded with Primal Scream, they couldn't have helped him make it any worse.

The album has a feel of desperation laced with incomplete thoughts, structured to guide the listener nowhere.  This is not punk, this is not 21st century punk, this is frustrating musical purgatory that will not last for more than one or two playings ... truly post Pop depression.  Here we find Iggy Pop making the rounds with Josh Homme, each hoping to gain some credibility from the other, just as Iggy so transparently did with Lou Reed, David Bowie, and a host of others.  Theres no search and destroy here, theres also no psych punk Queens of the Stone Age ear splitting anthems, its all slightly affected nervous energy, injected with a spirit that belays the end of a roller coaster ride ... no hills, no downward plunges or sharp curves, just the jittery end of the ride stop and dis-embarkment.

Sadly, the quality of her music has slowly passed away from the heart, and instead she has just relied on the severe over-demand of bigger has to be better, just like Michael Jackson did. Unfortunately, the quality of her work has caused her to lose her voice at the heart of the matter. Her songs like 7/11 from her Beyonce' Platinum Edition album have faltered badly. The song 7/11, definitely is one of her worst songs on the record, and shows that she has relied too much on being a dance diva to where her voice has suffered a setback in the soul.

1,4.0,False,"02 1, 2013",A19I5KZQM3CA6W,B000W21ER4,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},Mr. Jeep,"I can remember owning this album when I was in high school, so even though I now cannot stand Weezer in the least bit (now being 26), it would be childish of me to say that their music did not mean anything to me at the time. After all, at a younger age, most people can only digest music that is so sophisticated, right?

To stay on topic with this album, I can now honestly say that I do not enjoy the music on this album by any means. The guitar work is just too simple for my liking, the drumming just bores me beyond grief, the lyrics are cheesy at best, and Rivers Cuomo's voice doesn't do anything for me either. If anything, I find him to be whiny. I know some of you might want to jump down my throat for saying this, but I do not find Weezer to be that much more impressive than the Jonas Brothers. Sorry, but that is truly the way I feel, and I am not to sort of man who is going to lie.

After gaining more of an ability to explore more music outside the mainstream as I got older, I stumbled upon A LOT more bands out there who are not nearly as mainstream as Weezer, but whose music truly speaks to me in terms of first-class virtuosity, be it vocally, instrumentally AND lyrically. Such is especially the case with bands like Stratovarius, Symphony X, Kamelot, Sonata Arctica, Meshuggah, Insomnium, Voyager, Life of Agony, Dark Tranquillity or Morbid Angel, to give but a few of so many examples. From my current perspective, those bands actually know how to be creative, complex, artistic and actually put a good deal of life into their music by means or utilizing their talents to the greatest extent possible, nor do they do it just for the purpose of gaining mass appeal.

On the flip side, however, I guess Weezer have proven to be good in their own ways, and when I was actually a fan of theirs when I was a teenager, I might not have been able to digest the sophistication and complexity of those other bands I mentioned, but that is not to say that some who enjoy this album can't appreciate more complex music. Heck, as little as 6 or 7 years ago, I would likely have given this album 4, or even 5 stars instead of 1. In fact, I would still have been DEFENDING this album back then, as crazy as that sounds. After becoming a major fan of those other bands, however, I cannot help but feel cheated by Weezer when I reflect back on this album and upon my former self. It is just that I have DEVELOPED AND EVOLVED past the point where I find myself able to get anything out of a band like Weezer when it comes to musical appreciation or stylistic approach. Some may argue that this album turned out to be exactly as Weezer themselves wanted it to be, and I will not disagree with that. But then again, that is an argument that could also be used AGAINST them in the sense that it suggests that, as musicians, they are not even TRYING to be as good as they can be, but rather just doing all they can to appeal to the masses. After all, I used to be a fan, so I WOULD know, and I DO get it. Bottom line: It just no longer does anything for me. Simple as that.

A MESSAGE TO WEEZER FANS (Please read the WHOLE THING before you post ANY comments!!!):

I have a RIGHT to criticize Weezer. I have a right to criticize them, just like I can criticize any other band out there, especially since I used to listen to them on a regular basis, per the title of this review. Likewise, others have the right to criticize the types of bands that I like, such as the ones I mentioned here in my review, but I would never put myself through the unnecessary stress of defending them. This DOES go both ways.

If you are going to comment on this review, please spare me of any comments such as ""You're just jealous!"" or ""I'd like to see you do better!"" or ""How is it in your parents' basement?"" or ""You must jerk off to your computer!"" These types of comments do not have anything to do with the matter at hand, and are just futile attempts to disarm me, and if anything, they prove to me that you cannot think of any effective ways to invalidate my opinion. It is from my experience that Weezer seem to be the type of band that can spawn rabid fans, much akin to Justin Bieber, Lil Wayne or Britney Spears. It also appears to be alarmingly common for many of these people to make these types of comments on negative reviews of anything that they love and adore, be it music, movies, books, etc. and will just not accept the fact that not everyone will like what they like in same manner as they do. Not only that, but they like to make childish assumptions about the lifestyle of whoever writes these reviews, based on the common belief that is perfectly summed up as follows:

""Anyone who doesn't like what I like, and who dares to say that they don't like it, must be a complete loser with no job, no life and still live with their parents!""

FYI: I have a college degree (from a HIGHLY prestigious university, no less), and a very successful career at one of the world's leading financial services institutions, at which I am highly respected by both peers and superiors alike. Not only that, but I am actually more successful than BOTH my parents. If anything, they need me more than the other way around. To top it off, I enjoy working out at the gym, taking care of my 60-gallon fish tank, and going to concerts to support the bands I like. To top it off, I am the proud owner of a 2011 Jeep Grand Cherokee!!! I am actually VERY HAPPY AND PRODUCTIVE WITH MY LIFE!!! Henceforth, the above-quoted theory that any rabid fans are liable to spew off has been utterly demolished. OWNED!

If you are one of those people who would say any of these things or make these kinds of childish and irrational assumptions, then here is my advice to you: Please learn some proper debating skills, get some help, or just learn to accept opinions! Once you have allowed this sort of venom to come spewing from your mouth, or, in this case, coming off your keyboard, then you have automatically lost the argument, and I automatically own you, hands down. Weezer are NOT above criticism, and neither is any other band out there. Bands and artists across all genres have to deal with criticism all the time. NOTHING that you say is EVER going to invalidate my opinion of them or deprive me (or anyone else) of the right to speak out against them. If you cannot accept my opinion of your saviors, then KINDLY LEAVE! Thank you.

To those of you who would call me ""pretentious"" or ""music snob"" or ""self-righteous"" or ""self-absorbed,"" you are truly pathetic. If you read my many positive reviews (which FAR outnumber my negative reviews, btw), you will quickly find out just how diverse of a taste I truly have. In particular, and in answer to those people who would say that there is nothing wrong with music that is ""simple,"" (and there isn't) it may do you some good to read the positive reviews I have done on the following albums:

""Devil's Night Out"" by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
""Never Mind The Bollocks, Here's The Sex Pistols"" by The Sex Pistols
""The Essential Heart"" by Heart
""Highway To Hell"" by AC/DC
""Meat Is Murder"" by The Smiths
""The Strange Case Of..."" by Halestorm
""Greatest Hits"" by Tom Petty
""Complete Greatest Hits"" by The Cars
""Ugly"" by Life of Agony
""Remain In Light"" by Talking Heads

As far as music goes, what I have reviewed represents but a small fraction of what I have. My collection, of which this album used to be a part, consists of more than 1000 CDs, so that should tell you right away that I spend way more time enjoying what I like than I do criticizing what I do not like. OWNED AGAIN!

I also wish to point out that arguments such as ""Oh, but you can HEAR what they're singing!"" or ""You can actually sing along and/or dance to it!"" are simply NOT going to cut it. If you are going to defend Weezer, especially against a former fan such as myself, you are going to have to do better than that. Those comments still don't say anything about the actual artistic quality of the music itself, be it vocally, lyrically, instrumentally, etc. If you have something of a deeper, more substantial argument for me, I would be glad to take a challenge. ;)",I used to be a fan,1359676800,

Most people who review Nicks' music loves her persona as much as, if not more than, her actual abilities. But I look at her music, not just as a fan, but try to listen more objectively. Good artists do not always put out good music.

I like Nicks, though her recent work isn't what I would call stellar. She is more than a decent writer, but if she doesn't have the right producer, her material is banal. It's also not surprising that she, once again, visited old material (just as she did on her last record, and 'Shangri-La' and many on Fleetwood Mac's 'Say You Will' songs as well as their 'Extended Play).  She's been pulling stuff from 'the vaults' for at least a decade and a half  now. '24 Karat Gold' is not a new concept for her.

Had she released the actual demos instead of redos, THAT would have been something worth listening to.

Nicks has a few things going against her with '24'. While her voice might be stronger than it was in the mid-80s, it is also very limited in range. Kids, this is what 3 packs a day will do to you (her admission, not mine). She has very few songs which are arranged with any kind of high note....and I'm not talking them being that high.

Though with the right vocal arrangement, her material can work. She just doesn't have that here.

The other thing she is lacking is a balance of harmonies. She has been working with her two backing singers for 3+ decades and honestly, it worked initially, but that vocal combo is doing Nicks no favors. They are too similar to ever be considered 'harmony vocals'. Though harmony is exactly what Nicks needs to make her songs work.

...and dare I say it...she needs male harmony vocals.

Let's jump right to ""Twisted"". That song worked back in 1996 because of Lindsey Buckingham's production, arrangement  and yes, harmony vocals. (and let's forget that she released the demo on 'Enchanted' years back....so she's rehashing rehashed songs).

I find the vocals on this record to be very monotone. It goes back to her range, or lack of one.  For the good rhythm of ""Mabel Normand"", the she rarely moves off of two or three notes, making each line sound like a run-on sentence. The new version of ""Cathouse Blues"" can't even hold a candle to a very stripped down demo.

Whatever relationship/issues Nicks has Buckingham on how he handles her music, in the long-run her artistry is better for it. '24 Karat Gold' won't be going into any kind of rotation for me. It had potential, but it seems to be squandered.",Not Worthy,1412640000,

Then she starts running around, barking like a dog and swinging her artificially enhanced breasts at the screming audience. ""We love you Nicki!!"", the lemming-like fans cry out.

But let me backtrack a little bit.

I absolutely HATED the first album ""Boys & Girls""...too bluesy and not enough melody and no catchy hooks whatsoever.  I love soul singers, espesh those who rock, like Janis Joplin, Chris Cornell, etc, but they incorporate a melodic sweetness to counteract the raunchy rawness.  AS singer Brittany Howard is a shouter yes, but has no sweetness, it's all full throttle howl, no dynamics. VERY uncomfortable for me to listen to. I hate her tone completely, and last but not least, she is one UGLY woman...I can't even look at photos without gagging!!

From what I heard in the video, I thought, hmmm, have they improved??  I like the stylistic change, I took the disc out of the library, and I like the cover and the fact that the vinyl is clear...but I put it on, it started out promising, INSTRUMENTALLY, but once Brittany started, um, ""singing""??, uh oh...that ugly tone barrelling forth, ruining my brain, I couldn't get past track #2 without risking brain damage...totally unbearable.  Then I open up the booklet, and I see the photos...the rest of the band look like OK guys, kinda cool, but Brittany??

Like Medusa!!  Yikes!!

Sorry fans...and there are thousands...I can't understand what you see in this band or Brittnay as a singer...why my taste doe not agree in the slightest is a mystery, but for me, they are clearly America's WORST band by far!!

The reasons is because more than half the album is noisy feedback, and Peter Steele's songwriting shows how jaded he is with life, and the band.  The lyrics are very juvenile and uncreative, and musically, just noisy feedback that lasts for 15 minutes a track.

The only song I like off this album is 'These Three Things'.  I really didn't even care for September Sun, reminds me of Adam Sandler's song that he sang to Drew Barrymore in the movie ""Wedding Singer"". This is the first TON album that I can honestly say that I do not like.  I only like one song off the album, and even then its not what I call a radio friendly hit.

Sorry Peter and Crew, but your not getting any younger, and the music isn't getting better.  Quit while you are ahead so I can enjoy the great music that was once October Rust and Bloody Kisses.  I guess this is what happens when you run out of ideas when you are pushing 50.

Good,"Like many people, my first encounter with the 'music' of this young man followed a conviction for violence against a woman. Little surprise then, that this album if packed full of explicit references and veiled pornographic imagery - yet aimed squarely at kids and teenagers. The song 'wet the bed' is downright appalling.  A sad indictment of the current state of the music industry that the worlds most famous record label RCA, allowed this to be released.

In June 2010, Chris Brown's application for a visa to enter the UK was refused on the grounds of him ""being guilty of a serious criminal offence"". This followed criminal convictions that included a violent assault on a female pop star. Brown got lucky and was sentenced to five years of probation, one year of domestic violence counselling, and six months of community service; the judge retained a five-year restraining order on Brown, which requires him to remain 50 yards away from [the victim] Rihanna, 10 yards at public events.

It is with the above publicity that I learn about this 'singer' and I spend several hours sampling the album - trying to find out what the fascination is.

This individual sounds like a third rate karaoke version of a young Michael Jackson. This is 'painting by numbers' music. The tracks sound like they are straight off a studio factory assembly line. Unimaginative and repetitive references to 'make you love me' and 'i'm gonna do x,y,z to you' this is not music I would allow children to come within a mile of.

More mature artists perform this genre with a level of authenticity. This just sounds very young & amateurish.

The track 'Next To You' proves that Brown has some singing ability. How edited the track is, I do not know, but he can clearly sing. It only proves how utterly murky the whole situation is. Underneath the anger, the violence, the bad influences, there is probably a talented young man. Possibly, but I doubt there is enough talent to save this sorry character from a further life of crime.",A Stain On The Music Industry,1316995200,

When I first heard this song on the radio, I was totally dying for this song just to be a promotional single. Actually, I was also thinking ""You have totally GOT TO BE KIDDING ME. THIS is ACTUALLY a song?"". The fact that THIS SONG is becoming huge right now is totally shocking and intolerable. I am completely repulsed.

Why can't people realize that songs like this are not important to country music and turn to something from Sara Evans or Cassadee Pope instead? Even when good female singers are trying to make themselves useful and make songs that actually mean something, which are also songs that define importance, those female artists just get carelessly and recklessly tossed in the gutty water by untalented and uninspired female artists like Miranda Lambert. It's just saddening, depriving, heartbreaking, and disgustingly inexcusably WRONG!!! Listen, there are better songs out there.

To put it mildly, Beyonce is a horrible singer here, and she ruins a perfectly good song. Also, it's not a ""duet,"" but rather, insert Beyonce over the original track, nothing more, nothing less.

Overall, please don't buy this pathetic excuse for a song. It's one of the flat-out worst quality of song in 2007, Period.",Beyonce Ruins a Perfectly Good Song,1204761600,

Greg Graffin pointed at me several times. I remember during American Jesus, the guy next to me put his arm around me as we shouted the lyrics out. That was a seriously amazing time.

2010 would have been an awesome music year. Iron Maiden, my favorite band, put out their best album yet: The Final Frontier. In other news, Avenged Sevenfold released the half-assed Nightmare, Linkin Park continued their downfall with A Thousand Suns, and then this. Now I'll admit I did half expect this from Bad Religion- Everything after The Gray Race disappointed me (minus The Process of Belief and a few tracks from Empire).

The Day The Earth Stalled is a nice, fast paced opener, although it could have been longer. 3/5

Only Rain is easily the best track off the album and the closest to the Bad Religion I love. Great lyrics too. 5/5

Resist Stance is reminiscent of Suffer, so I like it a lot, plus Greg sounds awesome! 4/5

Won't Somebody- OK now this is where the album takes a nosedive. This could have been in a Tim Horton's commercial, it is that bland. 2/5

The Devil in Stitches- Boring. 1/5

Pride and the Pallor- Ditto.

Wrong Way Kids has a catchy chorus and that's about it. 2/5

Meeting of the Minds is a song that had potential to be great- they were going in the right direction when the did it, but they got to the chorus... what a disappointment. 3/5

Someone to Believe- OK seriously this is ridiculous. I cant believe Bad Religion did this. This sounds like post Nimrod Green Day (and I don't mean that in a good way) 0/5.

Avalon- HELL YES!!!!!!!!! FINALLY beneath the grime is a kickass face melter. Seriously this is why I listen to Bad Religion 5/5.

First. Copying Irreplaceable's beat almost completely was a terrible thing to do! Not original and we had ENOUGH of that song. That's what this song TOTALLY rides on! At least Chris Brown, even though it's a similar beat, has something going for his song, With You (better lyrics, nice video).

Altogether, I just don't appreciate either of them ripping the Irreplaceable beat off though.

It is just too sad that they haven't shown enough chemistry in regards to a song being more everlasting at the soul, and just sounds more like a fad eventually going away. That has honestly happened so often with a lot of girl groups from the Pussycat Dolls and others losing their career focus, and will only have maybe at least one song to stand the test of time alone. Unfortunately for Fifth Harmony, they have been really lagging in regards to better songs, and not showing individual harmonies and chemistry at the soul. They did barely show it with Write On Me from their 7/27 album. Work From Home though isn't actually a driven song that ignites from the heart, and the song just drags down overall.

The song ""Promise"" could be sung by Mariah Carey, and almost no one would notice that it was written by Tori. It's a safe-as-can-be pop ballad. I literally groaned in disgust as it played.

Sorry, Tori. I'll listen to your other albums, and I'll still go to your show when you come to town, but this album is going to be collecting dust.

The words are quite soothing and the melody is extremely captivating.  The instrumental accompanyment is very appropriate.  Also, the very next track, Arc Of A Diver, is quite ear friendly with a strong melody and good special effects.
After this strong opening, the rest of the record is quite dissappointing.  The remaining songs tend to drag within a few minutes.  Several of these so-called tunes even exceede the six minute mark in length with barely a distinguishable melody.  Guitars, natural sounding keyboards, and a driving drumbeat are almost non-existent.

Stevie's Back In The High Life is a considerable better effort as many of the tunes on that release are quite stylish.

The radio scene at that time had become so stale and boring filled with sissy alt rock bands posing as rock bands that a song with some actual teeth to it stood out amongst the audio fecal matter that was late 90's radio rock. Since getting their first album I've followed this band and they've been one of my favorite bands to come out over the past 20 years. I even have most of their bonus tracks, b sides and soundtrack songs, except the rap influenced stuff which wasn't my thing.  But honestly I think they're running out of ideas.

I loved 2010's Cold Day Memory at first, but as time went on I found that love wore off and now the album is only ok.  Black out the Sun is one of the most forgettable albums I've ever heard, I seriously tried really hard with that one and now we have Kill The Flaw.  The songs just aren't there anymore.  It's not that the material on here is bad.  It's just not memorable.  There are no catchy choruses, no memorable guitar riffs just nothing that makes me want to keep comong back.  Honestly I love a lot of their non album tracks more than these songs, or the songs on the previous album.  The sound is toned down and softer, kind of like Cold Day Memory, and the songs are very basic.  The vocals still sound good, and he has an awesome voice.  The band still has talent.  It's just that their songs have become stale to me.

The album opens with Thank You, which is a pretty solid track.  My only real complaint is I feel the guitars in the verses should have been heavier.  I'd also have sped up the chorus, kind of takes away from the momentum of the song.  But still it's a nice track.  Death Dance is also ok, one I do enjoy but don't really remember much.  The title track and bonus track have their moments and Letters has started to grow on me a bit, but that's about it.  One song has a cool acoustic part, with nice guitar work and a nice drum beat but I feel the slow electric section, when the electric guitars kick in, ruin the pacing of that song.  That part should have been faster too.  Other than that nothing really stands out.  Like I said these songs aren't necessarily bad, in fact there isn't a bad song on here.  They just aren't memorable and don't make me want to come back.  I could listen to tracks 1 and 2 and then stop and be perfectly fine.

Still the album is getting mostly positive reviews, of course on here it's amazon so most albums do, but I still recommend listening to it before getting it.

He bounced back with his best effort to date- 2008's ""Theater Of The Mind"" and things seemed to be going well- at least that's how Ludacris tells it. He talked about a concept album called ""Battle Of The Sexes""- a duet album between himself and Shawnna (best known for appearing on his song ""What's Your Fantasy"" and her hit ""Gettin' Some""). Unfortunately, Shawnna abandoned the project midway through completion, and rather than shelve the album, Ludacris soldiered on with the project. The end result is Shawnna appearing only on three songs- ""I Do It All Night"", ""B.O.T.S. Radio"" and the phone sex inspired ""Feelin' So Sexy"".

There are other guests who fill the absence left by Shawnna. Nicki Minaj steps in for the song ""My Chick Bad"", Ne-Yo appears on the Swizz Beatz produced ""Tell Me A Secret"", and Trey Songz makes a cameo on the rather dull ""Sex Room"". The songs ""Everybody Drunk"" and ""Party No Mo'"" are horribly out of place on this album. In fact, the only song that actually is in line with the concept of the album is ""B.O.T.S. Radio"". Things come to a close with the final track, The Neptunes produced ""Sexting"" which makes light of the Tiger Woods scandal.

Arie comes back (mighty fast, I must add) with her followup ""Voyage To India"". The concocted mask the lady wears wears a bit thin on ""Voyage"" as this album is severely so-so.
First off the production is weaker than on ""Acoustic"" and the lyrics are EXTREMELY clique (written in a pseduo-boho/ I-love-my-self stance).The songs don't do much for the listener either.
Tired duds like ""Little Things"" and the predictably titled ""God Is Love"" are predictable and shallow attempts to pass for ""deep"" when they come off like Hallmark card messages.
Bland ""folk""-flavored contemporary R&B follow and lead ""Voyage"" on it's meandering direction. It wouldn't too bad, I suppose, if the songs didn't come off so pre-programmed for an audience. ""Good Man"" is a 'free-spirited' urban radio morsel with second-rate Inyala Vanzant-esque writing. As with a majority of this record.
Fortunately, ""Voyage"" doesn't completely make you fall asleep with dribble. ""The Truth"" wins with some simple-yet-airy guitar parts and a slick but sincere beat but it's second-rate lyrics just make our girl stumble. ""Headed In The Right Direction"" is a wee-bit corny but has a slight Latin-influenced folk flavor and it stands out because Arie actually goes for something different instead of tired ""love yourself"" retreads.

Look, ""Voyage To India"" makes India to be more of a ""Black-girl"" version of bland, ""folk"" pop songbird Jewel than Miss Chapman or Lauryn Hill. And it's need to be said that just because a Black woman's not talking about being ""bootylicious"" or partying or ""her man"" and plays an instrument that doesn't make her deep. India's image is way too formatted and manufactured. Her songs on ""Voyage"" aren't  as introspective or enlighting as she may have intended them to be but rather boring and painfully cliqued most of the time. Not ""deep"".
India. Arie is very talented and deserves to write herself some better songs and challenge both herself and her 'audience'.

But, unfortunately her music hasn't really hit the home run in her recent records, and with more of her life the past few years on her marriage to Guy Richie ending, and her adopting African babies, she hasn't been able to really deliver to the big hits. That simple is also the case with Celebration, the new single from Madonna's upcoming anthology from her success with the Warner Brothers era. The song sadly doesn't really deliver the same spark Madonna had delivered throughout her past 26 years. The song sadly is not Madonna at her best.

Howe plays beautifully, but the songs are indeed kind of hollow and too simple for my taste after knowing what Yes can do musically.... You will freakin see what i am talking about.  It sounds a bit like Drama, but is nowhere near that great album.

It has a very good dark pop tone to it, great grooves, easy to get into. Vocally, again, sounds good, she has that dark tonal quality. My issue with the album is the lyrical content, it just seems hollow. The lyrics just seem very generic and not very personal at all. Many of the songs, including New Americana, and Strange Love, just have really generic and overdone meanings. Forget everyone, I'm better than them, I'm going to do what I want. Well high five, good for you.
Zella Day and Meg Myers actually feel like they are writing their music from experience. It's less about conveying a idea, and more about expressing their emotions through their past, and how they've learned to move on. They are songs people can listen to, and relate to, and apply to their own situations to hopefully find some healing in whatever difficulty they face. Halsey on the other hand neglects these things. While still ""dark pop"", the majority of songs are more about being the person you want to be and giving the finger to anyone who disagrees.

No followup single ignited quite the way that one did, with Stop and Stare being the only real success on Billboard. This time around, the band doesn't even try to replicate Apologize, which is a good thing. The beats are a bit harder and deeper, but not altogether dissimilar to Dreaming Out Loud. What results is an album that peaks high and doesn't so much dip low as just fade into facelessness.

Made For You: The opening track is solid, though not all that memorable. The hook is catchy, but the added outro is unnecessary and doesn't add much. C+

All The Right Moves: The lead single sounds like nothing from Dreaming Out Loud, making it a great song to introduce this album. The vocals are urgent and the beat is great, but it's not particularly epic. B

Secrets: The second single, and the best song on the album. The subtle beginning sparks and then ignites with the chorus, which is as catchy as anything OneRepublic has ever released. This should've been more successful. B+

Everybody Loves Me: A very odd song for this band to record, but very welcome. The beat is different, focusing on more percussion, and the whole thing is just fun with the ego in overdrive. A-

Missing Persons 1 & 2: Just as some momentum was forming, this stops the hooks dead. This isn't a bad song, but there's absolutely nothing exciting about it. C-

Good Life: A great song to recover with. The third song on the album to eclipse anything the band has done thus far, with a quiet melody that is very pleasant. B+

All This Time: While too similar in rhythm to the previous song, the hook saves this track from obscurity. Not too great, but not bad either. C+

Fear: Another song that recycles the beats of the previous song. The vocals are pretty strong, but this just isn't original enough. C

Waking Up: The same thing can be said for this track. This could have been merged with the previous two tracks without much hassle. C

Marchin On: Barely different from the previous two, and the same in nature lyrically to the previous. This is getting a bit ridiculous. C

Lullaby: This song was written to be sleep-inducing, and it does the job. I'm just not sure what the purpose that has on an album. D

Mercy (Bonus): Previously on the first album, this is a much better end to the album than the previous song is on the regular edition. This deserved more success as a single. B

This album is incredibly frustrating, due to how much potential was wasted. The first half is solid for the most part, but it seems like Ryan Tedder loves the beat on Good Life and decided to replicate it in very similar ways on the four songs that followed. Lullaby refuses to put a flailing album out of its misery, and this all equates to a 'singles' album. Combine four of these songs with the singles from Dreaming Out Loud, and that will get you a lean, solid OneRepublic release. As for this, it should be skipped.

When I first heard her song Work from her Anti record, I found that her own work was really a waste of time overall, and not even close to the voice that she could be and is not. Her latest song, Needed Me, follows in the very bad slide in her own work with songs like B&&&& Better Have My Money, and Kiss It Better. Overall, I really found the song to be short, and Rihanna had not been able to sound more like a siren, and instead just crashed and burned in the fire. She also sounded more like she was swearing and not showing more of her vocals. Personally, I did not like the song, and this song is not a must download, even for the hardest-cored Rihanna fans.

I have loved him since then and have seen him live a number of times - about once a year since then! But dare I say that I don't like this album by Chris? I ran out to buy it at Target on its release date but just couldn't love it. It's too much ""more of the same."" It seems like Ed Cash insists on keeping all Chris's songs structured the same - an 8 measure intro, an 8 measure verse, an  8 measure chorus, a 4 measure verse or the first half of the first verse, the chorus, a bridge, repeat chorus, end. The drums, bass and guitars are dull and unimaginative as well.

I LOVED ""Awake My Soul"" with Lecrae and that's the only song that made my iPod from the album. Download this song. It's one of the only songs worth owning.

""Whom Shall I Fear"" is just boring. Four on the floor throughout it, boring music. Yawn.

""Lay Me Down"" is lyrically weak, some phrases making no sense. ""Hand on my heart, this much is true, there's no life apart from you"" is a perfect example of that. It's another 4 on the floor song that sounds like a knock off of the sound on Mumford and Sons song ""I Will Wait."" You can lay this song's lyrics right over that song's music.

""God's Great Dance Floor"" is an OK song. I do like the mariachi trumpet but the 4 on the floor beat gets monotonous. I also don't like the build going into the bridge. It sounds messy and chaotic.

""White Flag"" is a down tempo anthem type song. While I like most of the lyrics, the music is suspiciously similar to Jesus Messiah from his 2008 album. Another 4 on the floor song with a snare cadence.

""Crown Him"" is likable. Chris enjoys taking hymns and adding a new chorus or bridge. It breathes fresh life into an old song. This is a good one to download too.

""Jesus Son of God"" is another 4 on the floor slow ballad type of song.

""Sovereign"" is the only song I love on the album besides ""Awake.""

""Countless Wonders"" recycles phrases and lyrics from earlier songs on his first albums.

""Thank you for saving me"" is yet another 4 on the floor song with cliche's throughout.

Basically if you like every song where the kick drum is playing on every beat (called 4 on the floor), then this is your album. Personally when all 12 songs are like that, I get bored with it.

I am a lifelong Yes fan, and they are my all-time favorite band (Dylan is my all-time favorite artist, Yes is my favorite band). I love these guys, and I have all of their albums. I saw this incarnation of Yes at the Tower Theater in Philadelphia last year (with Oliver Wakeman) and hung out with all of them backstage for quite awhile. I've always loved these guys, and I loved every album this band has released (including 1980's 'Drama,' 1987's 'Big Generator,' 1991's 'Union' and 1997's 'Open Your Eyes').

Until this one.

Look, I'm going to come out and say it, 'Fly from Here' blows. Yes, the Roger Dean cover art is great, and the funky Yes logo design is quite nice, but the music just isn't what it once was. The playing is alright, but it is not what it should be for musicians on this level. Benoit David is an okay singer, but I've come to the conclusion that he simply does impersonations on stage. He sounded alright the night I saw him, but he's either impersonating Jon Anderson or he's impersonating Trevor Horn (as he does here). Don't get me wrong, he's talented, and he's a nice guy too, but he just doesn't have much personality as a vocalist. That, for me, is a problem.

And then there is the production. Trevor Horn, in my opinion, is one of the best producers of the modern era. His work on '90125,' ABC's 'The Lexicon of Love,' and the Art of Noise records are just phenomenal. The guy is simply a genius as a producer. But on 'Fly from Here,' the production sounds very stale and quite amateurish, like he is using a GarageBand like computer program instead of proper production techniques. Considering all of the wonderfully produced records being made in this day in age (like Radiohead's 'The King of Limbs'), there is absolutely no excuse for a band like Yes to have an album this poorly produced, ESPECIALLY coming from a first-rate producer like Trevor Horn.

The songs are also somewhat of a disappointment. A previous reviewer described this really as a Buggles album, with Benoit David singing and Steve, Chris, and Alan playing along and occasionally throwing something in. To some extent, that is true. Steve Howe does get a solo piece here which is quite nice (I personally prefer 'Masquerade' from 1991's 'Union,' but that's just me), but the rest of it just doesn't seem to fit Yes very well. 'We Can Fly from Here' is a track that has been floating around since 1980, and it was even performed on the 'Drama' tour (a live version of it recorded at Madison Square Garden in New York in September of that year was released on the 2005 'The Word is Live' box set). Really, extending the track into a 22-minute suite just wasn't smart. The track worked brilliantly as a 6-minute tune, and if it were recorded on this album as it was performed on the 'Drama' tour, perhaps I wouldn't object to it. But trying to stretch it out into a lengthy epic suite like 'The Gates of Delirium' and 'Ritual' (and shortening it's title to 'Fly from Here') is just ridiculous. 'Life on a Film Set' could easily have appeared on the Buggles' 1979 album 'The Age of Plastic,' and 'The Man You Always Wanted Me to Be' is somewhat sappy, surprising coming from Squire. His voice doesn't sound bad, but the lyrics just aren't good.

Don't get me wrong, I do like the Buggles. But if I buy a Yes record, I want to hear Yes. I don't want to hear the Buggles. That why I bought 'The Age of Plastic.'

The final complaint I have is that Geoff Downes just doesn't click with Yes anymore. He is an ideal fit in Asia, with Wetton, Howe and Palmer, but in the 2011-present version of Yes, he just doesn't blend. He was right for Yes in the early '80s, but for some reason, he just doesn't seem to be on the same page as the rest of the band nowadays. He is a stellar keyboardist (one of the best), but he just seems out of place in the new Yes.

Look, I'm all for Yes trying new things, but this album just doesn't work. It isn't well produced, it's not well written, and in 20 years, when one is making a list of what they would consider classic Yes songs, let's be honest, NONE of these songs would even be contenders. This album is the first time I have ever felt disappointment from my favorite band, and I hope it is the only time. If this were some other band, maybe this record wouldn't bother me. But I was expecting so much better from musicians like Yes.

I recommend the album 'The Living Tree,' by Jon Anderson & Rick Wakeman, which is also new for 2011. While that record is far more stripped down, it is well produced, it is far more intimate, and it is also better performed. That is the record Yes fans should be buying. 'Fly from Here' isn't. Buy 'The Living Tree' before 'Fly from Here.'

Overall, this record was such a letdown to me. Like I have said, it is the only Yes album that has left a sour taste in my mouth. I hate to jump on the bandwagon (especially because I am such a fan of the 'Drama' album), but this group needs Jon Anderson back desperately. Peter Frampton also played the night I saw Yes, and he definitely outperformed them that night. But that's irrelevant. The new record just isn't what it should be. I had such high expectations for this band's first album in 10 years. This album was well below my expectations.

I know I'm going to get a lot of unhelpful votes for this, but honestly, stick with the Yes albums you already have. If you don't own 'Fly from Here,' take my word for it: you aren't missing much.",Eh...,1322956800,

Sincerely, and sadly the quality of her songs have absolutely been awful. The surprise album she pulled out last year has had some really bad songs from Partition to Pretty Hurts. But her latest song is definitely one of biggest low points, trying to be a edgy hip hop artist, and instead throws it all away. Flawless, the latest single from her lackluster self-titled record is really a pathetic song. She doesn't actually deliver from each and every note. Not only is the chemistry she and Chimamanda awful, it sadly is just as poorly overplayed as her work with her husband Jay-Z on Drunk In Love.

The hype over this album was said that it was supposed to be the best produced album in years by Jackyl. That might be true, but the materiel wasn't worth producing well to begin with.

There is a bunch of filler among a couple of meh songs. Not one single song here sticks out above the rest as the best song on the album. They all are a mediocre at best rating. Nothing here is worthy of being added to the live set or worthy of being added to the listing of Jackyls 'best of'.

Usually I like when Jackyl do cover versions, but even ""Everyone's a winner"" here is a song that is just meh, not a song I liked before and still don't. The only track that seemed to have anything going for it was the final one, but then again, how many times is Jessie Dupree going to try and write the same song? Enough with the ""Rev it up and go"" already. The same can be said for ""Just because i'm drunk""... it's just a watered down version of ""Secret of the bottle"".

I don't get why some have already said ""Rally"" is a favorite of theirs? The song sounds silly with lyrics ""Rally, Rally, Rally, Uga, Chugga, Ugga Chugga""... really? Was this inspired by wanting to see a rally car being driven by that 20 year old dancing baby animation thing? Not to mention the chorus seems to be something they slapped over another song and it sounds out of place together.

This album has failed to rock me, roll me or jackly me off in any way. Sure, the production is good, but you know what they say about something in particular that you can polish. The attempt at a deeper sound of metal too doesn't seem right for Jackyl. It sounds more like them trying anything to keep current, and thats not why fans stick with them.

I haven't given up hope, and think Jackyl can still bounce back, but they sure are not the same band they once where. They really need to find themselves again and work out what made their first couple of albums great. Nothing here is worthy of being noteworthy of a Jackyl classic.","The bad, the worse and the ugly",1470355200,

In fact I had no idea it even *was* a comic book character.  The description for the movie sounded appealing to me, so I made the horrendous decision to watch it assuming I was going to be impresed by an action flick but.. wow does it ever seriously unquestionably STINK!

Good luck trying to follow along to any kind of storyline.  The pacing of the film mainly focuses around cheesy explosions coming out of nowhere, a woman who works as a prostitute and her daily struggles dealing with men who want to kill her, and people lying dead in the ground coming back to life for a few minutes to reveal important information before quickly slipping back into death again.  I really don't get any of this of course.

Just keep in mind that you probably need to understand the comic book character of Jonah Hex in order to grasp the storyline.  Otherwise you'll be left sitting there totally confused and uninterested in just about everything taking place on screen.

Even without understanding any of the storyline segments, it doesn't exactly take a rocket scientist to realize the acting is terrible all around.

Sadly, the last several songs she had put out like #Beautiful and the lackluster Triumphant from 2012 have been less than stellar in regards to voice and absolute spirit. Sadly, with the songs she has came out with from her upcoming album The Art Of Letting Go, they just haven't added up in regards to voice and spirit in what Mariah had been known for. Her latest song You're Mine Eternal is not one of Mariah's better songs, and feels weak in her voice and soul in what a love song can really be. The song alone is not really anything worth raving about, but remixed with Trey Songz on the song, feels worse in voice and spirit. As for Trey Songz, he has had better collaboration with other divas like Toni Braxton a few years ago with Yesterday which was more sensual and delivered better in the mood.

The difference is that the breakup in question was not a romantic one (or at least I don't think so), but an artistic one - this is the first Elton John album without Bernie Taupin adding lyrics! Gary Osbourne provides them instead, and where Taupin is blindingly misogynistic, Osbourne is sickeningly obvious - honestly, if I hear one more song that contains the lyric ""Playin' with my heart!"" (i.e. ""It Ain't Gonna be Easy""), I will get a bunch of other people who are sick of that lyric together and file a class-action suit against every songwriter who ever used the term, which means a lot of money would exchange hands. The good news is that, musically speaking it's still Elton, and Elton melodies and arrangements were always spot-on - indeed, the strings, guitar, and vibes on ""It Ain't Gonna be Easy"" are no exception to this rule. All it needs is better lyrics. Sadly, a lot of the ""rockers"" are bitter pills to swallow: ""I Don't Care"" is drenched in ""good-time"" synths; ""Part Time Love"" seems forced and has a dated guitar tone; ""Big Dipper"" sounds too much like ""Suzie (Dramas)""; ""Madness"" is the closest Elton's come to arena-rock, and I'm glad he never came anywhere near again. Elton's better off when he sticks with balladeering, on gospel-influenced tracks such as ""Shine on Through"" and ""Georgia"" (with the famed Brit referring to it as ""his home"" - ha! Stupid Gary Osbourne. Was he from Georgia?). And, well... wait a sec? What was I doing praising the ballads? ""Shooting Star"" is a flaming bag of crap left on Taupin's doorstep!

The Mobile tape sounds somewhat better here than on bootleg editions. The primary fault is with the group's performances. As we all know,the Monkees were singer/actors hired to portray musicians,and on the group's first 2 studio albums,98% of the instruments were played by sessionmen.

Typical Monkees fans would be best advised to buy Rhino's ""Live 1967"" CD,which creates one ideal set from the three professionally recorded shows(all the shows had the same song line-ups).For those who do purchase this 4-CD set,you'll note that none of the selections in the 3 professionally recorded shows match exactly with the recordings as heard on ""Live 1967"".I suspect that on ""Live 1967"",that Rhino engineers(who had access to 3 renditions of each songs) spliced between renditions,used sampling,or (perhaps) had The Monkees come into the studio to overdub/correct the recordings.

Also, the chemistry she and her husband has shown in the song is so poor that I don't even know if they should work together. They had better songs like Crazy In Love, but this song is really the pits. If you are new to Beyonce', I would say pass this song up.

2,2.0,False,"10 3, 2012",A2U80IPZXN5V1U,B009AQOZIS,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},T. Skylar,"I love Iron Maiden obviously and Steve Harris has been the driving force of that band since its inception, more than anyone else Maiden is Steve's baby. Steve Harris IS Iron Maiden let's get that out of the way. When Harris announced a solo project I thought it was great for him, it was an opportunity to flex his musical muscle outside of the beast that is Iron Maiden and that he could do whatever else he wanted with this one record. In fact I was kind of surprised that he hadn't done this sooner like Bruce Dickinson and Adrian Smith had, but at the same time Maiden was his reason to live all along. It took long for him to decide to do a solo album and in 2012 we have Steve Harris' first solo album, British Lion. Actually it's more of a side project than a solo record really. The origins of British Lion for further than we'd think. Harris mentored the band of the same name in the early 1990's and nothing happened, stayed in touch with some of the musicians and years later they worked out some music and release this.

At first I thought the title was a little bland, but I didn't care much it's about the music. Then it hit me that music is very much like the title, bland. It's generic and doesn't really go anywhere, yet doesn't exactly play it safe either and it ends up being quite honestly boring and blank at times. One thing that Maiden brought in the music was power, here there is no power at all it seems to be the exact opposite. It sounds more like a mainstream and commercial rock album than anything else, and I think outside of hardcore Iron Maiden fans supporting Harris there isn't much of a market at all for it.

""This Is My God"" opens the album and from the start you get a sense that it's going to be different than Steve Harris' usual work and it indicates much of the sound of the album and the direction they were going with. I just find this first song inconclusive, it doesn't do a great job at putting the listener in any mood and it's not effective and a little disappointing to start British Lion with. ""Lost Words"" is much better and paints a nice imagery and feature strong lyrics it picks up the pace a little. ""Karma Killer"" isn't bad and it's almost catchy and I say almost because the vocals just don't go to that next level to bring out the catchiness of the song although it has a nice chorus and feel. ""Us Again The World"" is one of the songs that works, it's one that I could almost picture Bruce singing and Iron Maiden performing, but again the vocals aren't there to take it places, they don't soar, they don't do anything and aren't pleasant, remarkable or passionate.. etc and the list goes on. It's a big problem on the album and it fails to excite the listener. ""The Chosen Ones"" and ""A World Without Heaven"" are to me the best tracks on British Lion and they're side by side incidentally. Those are the songs that got me thinking ""well this is interesting, maybe it's not so bad..."" and after listening back found myself thinking that the rest of the album should have sounded a little more like that. Musically they go farther than the rest of album (except perhaps the closing piece ""The Lesson"" which could fit just below that category) and they're catchy and got me rocking and kept my hopes up for the rest of the album.  ""Judas"" is one of the better songs here it has a two minute slow breakdown piece and shows traces of prog and is overall a good song and one that I found myself listening to more often. ""Eyes of the Young"" is boring generic radio rock and doesn't go anywhere really, it's just a very plain song with no feel musically or otherwise I nominate that one the worst track on BL. ""These Are The Hands"" doesn't do it for me, it lacks in the chorus and as a result never arrives or get started.  ""The Lesson"" is not a ballad, but it's definitely a soft song and it features strings and piano and while I actually find myself enjoying it, it just seems out of place on this album as a closing piece especially (but then again it doesn't really fit between any two songs so where else to put it?).

I'm obviously a fan of Steve Harris for his bass playing and Iron Maiden, but I won't bow down to everything that he releases with or without Maiden. I don't think British Lion is close to be an outstanding album that's all. I think most of the problem is the vocals aren't quite up to par. They're not strong but they're not weak yet they hardly do anything even if they don't sound bad, which I realize may be an odd description but it's exactly what they sound like to me. There's very little energy in the songs too, as I said it sounds very blank at times music is playing but it's just... empty. Is it utterly unlistenable? No. There are even some good tracks like ""The Chosen Ones"" but the album and ultimately this whole project falls flat unfortunately and we're left with an album where not much stands out unfortunately. Again not dissing on anyone, they tried but it just doesn't seem to work. I wonder what Dickinson could have brought to some of those songs because some of the lyrics and themes that they had here had more potential than the final product shows.

To me British Lion was Harris doing a side project and not a solo album it was great for him that for the first time he did something besides Iron Maiden. It was a way for him to do stuff more akin to that of bands he idolized in the 1970's like Thin Lizzy and although it doesn't sound much like his influences it sounds more like 70's and particularly 80's rock than Heavy Metal (even the songs are considerably shorter than some of what Maiden has being doing with their last four albums. I don't hate British Lion, but I don't love it. The album could have benefited greatly from better production too. To me it's not totally a throwaway and it's not gold either but I'm definitely on the fence about this one and I will remember it as more of a novelty, an experiment, something outside of Maiden for Harris than a good, rock album. The main problem is the vocals aren't strong enough nor do they stand out to bring out the music and make it stand, in fact it's the opposite it brings it down. I'm sorry but I tried it's just not an album that's for me I'm afraid 2 1/2*.",An overal weak lion (2 1/2*),1349222400,

Released in 1997, this is Widespread Panic's fifth CD.  The sound quality is very good.  It is 49 minutes long, but the last 4 minutes of Greta is just a very annoying scraping, buzzing sound.  The CD originally came in a cardboard foldout case.

There is something that is not quite right with this CD.  The production values and engineering are very good.  I think it is that the compositions are just not very good.

This is one of those singer/song writer albums that every jam band puts out.  Everyone wants to do an American Beauty (Grateful Dead's landmark album).  Moe had Dither, String Cheese Incident has One Step Closer and Phish had Picture of Nectar.  They were all failures.

To make a singer/song writer album, the group usually brings in an outside producer.  This producer than molds the album around his vision, instead of the band's.  It usually doesn't work.

John Keane produced this album.  He also produced the previous Ain't Life Grand, where he was very succesful.  I think that with Ain't Life Grand, he made the album better by cleaing up the sound, but not interfering with the group's artistic vision.  On this CD, Bombs & Butterflies, he might have too much influence.

It also sounds like the group is trying to copy others.  Aunt Avis sounds like LA country rock by someone like the Buffalo Springfield or Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.  Happy, is an Allman Brothers type instrumental, but is not very interesting.  Many of the songs are along the standard Southern Rock music style.  You Got Yours sounds like it has a little Deep Purple mixed in.  Greta has a Pink Floyd like opening.

The album does have a very good sound.  The playing and mix are excellent.  He also contained John Herrman's keyboard playing so that really enhances the songs, instead of detracting from them.

But, the songs just are not very good.  And the best songs,  Rebirtha and Greta are on the live CD Light Fuse, Get Away and Tall Boy is on Classic City.  You could get those and skip this CD.

The worst songs, Aunt Avis and Hope in a Hopeless World were written by someone else.  The group should stick to performing their own songs, or JJ Cale songs.

So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).",A Covers Album That Could Have Been So Much More Than Just YESTERDAY!,1126224000,

According to the man himself, music is his first love, and if it came to having to choose between acting & music, music would always win out. So, what does he offer us, as a way to see if he is as talented a musician, as he is a actor.
Well, firstly there's his voice. On many reviews I have read around the web, he has been castigated for his singing voice, which I think is a little harsh. Bob Dylan and Lou Reed are two artists that, to my ears, haven't got the greatest voices in the world, but that doesn't stop them from having success and award selling albums. To these ears his voice suits the music on offer.

The exception to this rule and my favourite track on offer here is 'Spanish Love Guitar' in which Terence show cases his skills on said guitar.

Some of his '90s-edge has escaped him, but for the most part, he still sounds like the same old Redman, except what relevance does he serve in today's growing and competitive rap landscape? His reputation would suggest that it's near impossible to picture the merry and mean emcee hopping on some erudite conscious tip, and that's exactly what he doesn't do on Mudface (Nov. 13), his eighth solo LP and his first album not on Def Jam Recordings. The followup to 2010's Reggie, Mudface is instead catered by Red's Gilla House Records, and it's obvious the Def Jam panache is missing. The hard truth is that though his veteran hall of fame status in the game is vaulted for good, he just isn't the hottest ticket in town anymore, and on top of that, on Mudface, he shows no new angles and just doesn't outdo himself.

Despite its too many shortcomings, Mudface does house the fun, wild unmediated jollies Redman has always been known to get his rocks off with, but now, name-dropping celebrities, referencing pop culture, partying in the club, smoking his grade A stash, and belting out a few namesake catchword anthems is not going to make the cut. The Gilla House posse song ""Undeniable"" is nice, but it's unlikely the beginning of a super group. ""Bars"" contains some of the best lyrics on the album, but Redman should have gone that hard lyrically on the rest of the tracks. What remains is medium well wordplay in flawless moderato obsequious to Redman's well established formula.

Sadly, the production is also poorly innovative, a music relic of Red's heyday that bypassed the necessary sound upgrades, giving us a trip back in time that we don't necessarily need. This is clean content compared to the controversial hip-hop material of the present, making Red an option for today's kids that parents might let slide. Redman pokes fun at enough new phenomena and landmark events that came about since Reggie to give Mudface an intriguingly current timeliness, and he will no doubt attract a few new fans, but in short, the album is short (thirteen tracks clocking in at thirty-four minutes) with fading fortunes, no surprises and no brilliant answer to the question, 'So what?' in regards to the purpose and importance of the album.

Unfortunately, the ballads she has came out with have been poor, but one in a few have been good, but not going as strong from the soul. So when it came down to her pulling a surprise record out for her fans, most of the songs have been more like a waste of time than really worth the effort. XO is one of those songs that really doesn't ignite as a ballad. She really didn't strike the way she tried to do when she covered Etta James' classic standard, At Last.

When I first heard M&S, I, too, found them revelatory. It was intensely refreshing to hear popular music that has soul--so much soul that they couldn't help but to project it at the tops of their lungs. It was a desperately needed reply to the current ""I don't care / we do what we want"" irreverent dance-pop glitz ethos.

Many listens later, I see M&S differently. The music reliably invokes excitement but, in doing so, it finds no space for subtlety or understatement. Their roots are in Back Country bluegrass and folk -- genres that are all about stories -- but in M&S's music there are no stories. Rather, this album is a lot like U2's City of Blinding Light: Biblical imagery expressed in generic terms. A flailing attempt to capture spirituality. Or maybe just to prevent boredom. Instead of stories intended to shake and inspire, we get posturing and shouting intended to excite. After a while, all the excitement becomes exhausting and empty, not unlike the dance-pop glitz they oppose.

I believe people are starved for deeper rewards than Maroon 5 and their dance-pop contemporaries offer, and I believe that's why M&S are the top-selling musicians in the country (and by a wide margin), because they give the instant impression of heartfelt folky soulfulness. But the truth, revealed after enough listens, is that they are closer to stadium rock. To find deeper rewards, you have to look to the folk / bluegrass / celtic roots that have inspired them: Bob Dylan or Van Morrison, or even more recent acts like Ray LaMontagne or Amos Lee. Their music may not be as instantly pleasurable or exciting as M&S's, but if you give it your patience and attention, you just might find rewards that are far more precious than excitement.","A revelatory, deeply meaningful expression of passion... or is it?",1349481600,

Now, with the oversaturation she had endured with making Lemonade, many people wonder if it was worth it, and tragically it is not worth it at all. The album in itself has been her lowest performing in not just sales, but airplay as well, since the failure of 4. Beyonce's latest single is more of heartbreak in regards to her marriage with Jay-Z, and also the failure of her mom, Tina's marriage ending in divorce, after Matthew Knowles cheated on Tina, and fathered a child out of wedlock. Hold Up, the third single from Lemonade, is the exact same and so-called heartfelt feeling of being taken for granted at the affair of the heart.

Dre had started his own label, Aftermath, and was ready to sit back, renounce his gangsta image and watch the money roll in. While Death Row was reeling from the death of 2Pac and the disappointing sales of Snoop's Doggfather album, Dre was poised to start a new rap empire.
So out he came with this Aftermath sampler compilation, and we didn't hear from him again for three years. The reason? The album more or less ... and Dre's midas production touch was missing on most of the four or five songs he actually had a hand in.
It's a shame, too, because the one Dre track on the album, ""Been There, Done That,"" is really good. The production is smooth and silky, with distinctive percussion and a lazy bass line, and Dre sounds more confident and comfortable than ever as he brags about his earthly possessions. (""I've got a palace in the hills overlooking the sea / It's worth eight, but I only paid 5.3."") An entire post-gangsta Dre album in this vein would have sold through the roof, but alas, he hadn't the creative energy for it.
The other album highlights can be summed up in a couple paragraphs. KRS-One, Nas and B-Real of Cypress Hill perform under the name Group Therapy with ""East Coast / West Coast Killas,"" a Dre-produced track that picks up where ""Natural Born Killas"" left off. The vocal trade-offs are seamless, the bass is solid and the whistling Dre synth is bad@ss as ever.
Mel-Man, who co-produced Dr. Dre 2001, gets his solo track in ""Sh**tin' on the World,"" which overcomes its rather non-descript Dre beat with humor, intentional and otherwise. (Mel's liner notes read, ""I grew up with roaches y'am saying straight reppin' the projects to the fullest!"")
The aborted R+B girl group Hands-On turns in the piano-heavy, sultry groove ""Got Me Open"" with a Dre rap reminiscent of the same era's ""No Diggity."" And RC (the only artist on the album with two songs) turns in a decent, funky remake of David Bowie's ""Fame.""
Otherwise, the album is indistinct, passed down to Dre production apprentices like Bud'da, Floyd Howard, Flossy P and Maurice Wilcher. There's a reason acts like Miscellaneous, King T, Nowl and Sharief never took off. As an intro record-label sampler, you have to wonder if Dre planned to produce or oversee albums from all these acts or if he was just looking to put together a half-@ssed compilation and laugh all the way to the bank while Death Row went under.

While there are a number of highlight moments on this CD, including an energetic ""90 Degrees and Freezing"", a Motown-inspired, horn driven ""Come to Me Do"" and a catchy and powerful pop gem ""Feel"" (all penned by all-time great songwriter Robert Lamm), the record suffers from an over-abundance of ballads and sorry, over-blown production. I'm not a producer, but I know what sounds good to my ears.
I have nothing against some ballads on a Chicago album, but the ones on this Chicago album, the first recording of all-original material in 15 years, are simply not good, whether from a songwriting or performance standpoint. I won't go down the list, but will cite ""King of Might Have Been"" as an example of bassist Jason Scheff's mostly able tenor painfully straining to hit notes out of his range.
I don't know what producer Jay DeMarcus was thinking in putting this together as a Chicago CD, but the end result is a lot of tracks sounding like his own band, Rascal Flatts. No more to say as this speaks for itself.  As confirmed by the band, DeMarcus was also responsible for choosing the material for the recording, and pushed aside many songs written by the band members in favor of the mostly trite fare that shows up on ""XXX"". Considering that Robert Lamm and Bill Champlin have proven they can still pen solid pop/rock/R&B songs as found on their string of solo recordings, a CD of Chicago-only songs would, undoubtably been more listenable and a more worthy end product than what we hear on ""XXX"".
Finally, DeMarcus uses an army of studio musicians in place of the actual band members, thereby destroying any integrity this album would have had at least as a document of a Chicago band performance.

Part I: Dream Theater has put out concept albums before.  Theyve put out double and triple albums.  They are a well-known and well-regarded group of gifted musicians with backing deals and monetary funds to help them put out products of excellence and ambition that lesser known bands simply cant compete against.  So then how can they put out a conceptual double album that fizzles out practically before it even gets started?  One of my favorite bands, a small little independent group called The Violet Burning, with a pittance of a following put out a conceptual triple album a few years ago (around the time that Green Day got some mild publicity for releasing three albums in three months if I recall correctly) that blew my socks off.  How could they pull that feat off but Dream Theater put out a wishy washy (dare I say wimpy) piece of fluff like this?  It boggles my mind.  I expect so so so much more from them.  Theyve got such a great catalog!  But not this.

Part II: The Astonishing is musically mild.  It is rarely heavy and hardly ever muscular.  Its melodies are underwhelming.  Youll find ambient and future-computer-code sounds, which are perhaps the most musically interesting tracks on the album, sprinkled throughout.  Youll hear a song that starts out like a Christmas tune (Im not kiddingcheck out A Savior In the Square) and I even had a moment listening to one of the tracks that made me recall The Carpenters of all bands!  What is this!?!  Dream Theater has thrown their chops around with ballads and even some close-to-standard rock songs but they usually stay close to the progressive metal sphere and love to let their collective hair down on epic tracks that take their time and take the listener on an adventure.  Theyve eschewed all of that this time around in favor of a wealth of short to average length songs that allow keyboard concepts to mostly take the leads.  Sure the guitar is there but it is almost always playing second fiddle to other elements of the song, or providing an additional melody.  If there are wild drum and bass excursions then Ive missed them amidst all of the songs trying to bewell, songs, that all add up to a story.  A hackneyed, dystopian future where a musical genius can be the savior story.  The packaging is pretty!  The interior booklet has some nice art in it!  But that cant make me like these songs.  There are a couple that pass muster but theres nothing that is anywhere near the greatness that Dream Theater can achieve.  I enjoy the feel good arena rockish anthem Our New World.  LaBrie sounds pretty good there and its rousing, but theres little else that generates serious interest.

Part III: Concepts albums may be harder to pull off than a regular release but in the end, just like regular releases, they have just as good a chance to be cool or to suck.  This one sucks.  It doesnt suck because of the production.  Productions fine, sound levels are paid attention to, arrangements while lacking the usual DT dynamic are still tight, and the musicianship is fine.  But it sucks because its boring.  And the story is linear, obvious, surface, and just boring.  Sure there are other concept albums that fail (check out, or better yet dont, P.O.D.s The Awakening) but there have been so many great ones.  DT has a few of their own with Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence being at the top of my list.  But what this album needed this time around to really help it out was different voices.  LaBrie carries the vocals and speaks for many different characters and because he cant make them distinct characters via his own voice he ends up hurting this release (it still wouldnt have been great even if they used other vocalists though).  I wonder if he remembered working on Ayreons The Human Equation and heard that fantastic end product, carried through by a variety of singers, to work out its concept exquisitely?  Did he ever think of doing the same?  Well never know.  Best to put this one behind us and move on.

When all is said and done one can listen to the album and not hate it.  You can find some different points of interest.  But I think that, as a whole, you're hard pressed to find that you enjoy the entirety.  I think most Dream Theater fans will be mightily disappointed and I don't see this making many new fans.  Not even of bands like Nightwish, Epica, Vanden Plas and others who play up offerings similar to this.  They at least do them up pretty well.  I want DT to go back and play their long songs.  2.5 stars of disappointment.",Astonishing in its mediocrity.,1473465600,

Instead, the songs have been a big boatload of jiggles that haven't really hit the nail on the head at all. She had a lot to prove after the smash of Born This Way and that didn't happen at all. She showed that failure with Applause and Do What U Want with R. Kelly on the album, and she had decided to release another version of that song with Christina Aguilera, and sadly it misses the mark as well. The two of them not only do not have enough chemistry, but fail to ignite voice and soul altogether. I think that Lady Gaga needs a real reality check for the next set of songs she releases.

So when Rick Springfield announced that he was taking a break from songwriting and was recording a full album's worth of covers, made up of songs he'd always loved and wished he had written, I thought ""Cool...this just might work!"" Sadly, that's just not the case...THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is a tepid affair, with pretty much note-for-note arrangements of the original versions and weak, at times almost lazy, vocals. Now, I believe each and every one of us is entitled to their own opinion when writing a review like this, but I gotta be honest with you...I'm really shocked to read some of the die-hard fan's reviews stating that this CD captures and exhibits Springfield's true talents. Believe me, in MY opinion, none of the vocal nuances, emotions or guitar wizardry that was evident on his last two releases (1999's KARMA and last year's powerful SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE) are anywhere to be found on this latest CD. Things kick off with a gauzy version of 10CC's ""I'm Not In Love."" I'm sure Springfield's breathy lead vocal is supposed to represent pain and anguish but, in the end, it just comes across as over the top. And don't even get me started on how silly and dated the ""Big boys don't cry"" lyric sounds 30 years down the line! (Though the ""I keep your picture/Upon the wall/It hides a nasty stain/Just lying there/So don't you ask me/To give it back"" still packs a wallop!). Things continue along the same path with ""Under The Milky Way"", ""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Broken Wings."" Oh, sure, ""Under...."" has some nice acoustic guitar work, while there's a genuine earnestness to Springfield's vocal on ""....Town"" but, ultimately, each track - particularly the last two - collapses under the weight of various wrong turns (length and an over-blown chorus for ""Town"", an awful vocal arrangement and truly dated vibe for ""Wing""). No, things don't really kick in until the fifth cut, the ethereal ""Human."" Springfield not only manages to capture the pain of the original, he builds on and betters it. All the elements that made this a hit over twenty years ago are still there (a true testament to the writing genius of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis!), but thee's also a freshness and vulnerability that reverberates throughout the track. My only complaint....the cheesy pseudo-British female backing vocal (used two or three times too many throughout the disc!); I think the track would have had even more puch if Springfield had instead asked a fellow 80's survivor (say, Martha Davis, Terri Nunn or Pat Benatar) to join him. ""Holding On To Yesterday"" starts out with a nice, sultry groove, but then the horns kick in and the histrionic lead vocal sends the whole thing over and off the deep end. Moving in any number of directions, this is a song that ultimately spins out of control, not sure which course it wanted to take. ""Baker Street"" is another track that (sadly) fizzles. Yes, the sizzling guitars and wailing sax are intoxicating, but that's nothing new....they were 25+ years ago when Gerry Rafferty first released the song. You can't better it, you can't improve upon it, you certainly can't change it.....so why even try?!? All I can think of is Rick wanted to (re)introduce a classic to his younger fans...if that's the case, good for him! ""Waiting For A Girl Like You"" might have been a nifty left-field choice to include on SHOCK/DENIAL/ANGER/ACCEPTANCE, but here it just seems very run-of-the-mill. It's at this point that things picked up for me on the disc...not knowing much about Blue Nile, Westlife and Lizz Wright, their tracks almost seemed like new, original material to me. Couple that with a Beatles track and a John Lennon cut, plus the sole Springfield original, and you have many of the strongest moments on THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY. ""Let's Go Out Tonight"" has a smokey, sexy quality to it, with some beautiful sax snaking in and out and a plaintive lead vocal coaxing the listener in. Add some delicate keyboards and muted percussion and you have the disc's best track. Covering the Beatles is always tough, but you just have to plug your nose and jump in feet first, and that's what Springfield does on ""For The One."" Much like ""Human"", he honors the original, but manages to put his own spin on things, making it sound fresh, contemporary and, most importantly, like it was one of his own. There's an understated quality to ""Miss You Nights"" that's both captivating and mesmerizing....the arrangement is thoughtful and uncluttered, while Springfield's vocal both soars and swirls. Another winner! ""Blue Rose"" is absolutely elegant, with a raspy, yet sincere, lead vocal and a jazz club combo-vibe to the arrangement...piano, guitar, drums and (especially!) sax all come together brilliantly. ""Cry"" is the disc's lone original cut, a powerful track that could have easily fit on S/D/A/A. With it's soaring lead vocal and thoughtful lyrics (""You've got to cry/And surrender to it tonight/Time alone/Won't heal your wounds/It just makes you numb""), it's yet another strong number. Things wrap up with ""Imagine"", a VERY tough song to cover (I mean, c'mon, it's JOHN LENNON's signature song!)....let's just say, Springfield doesn't embarrass himself. Unfortunately, that can't be said about THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY as a whole....after two very strong releases, this disc is a definite step -or two!- backwards for Rick Springfield (Normally, I would also be docking the disc another half a star for not including the lyrics, but I know acquiring the publishing rights to a disc's worth of cover tunes could be costly, so I'll waive that rule here).",A Covers Album That Could Have Been So Much More Than Just YESTERDAY!,1126224000,

For Kelly Sweet, who did a brilliant rendition of Aerosmith's Dream On a few years ago that worked well, it definitely has been a surprise, but for continuing that with others it just doesn't work as well. It works poorly like Mariah Carey trying to do another rendition of a Def Leppard song as if they were trash. Kelly's cover of Phil Collins' massive staple In The Air Tonight doesn't feel like it actually has the stamina. In fact, the cover feels whitewashed and made cheaper in voice and absolute harmony of the soul. I really was not impressed with the song, and for Kelly, trying to be something she is not is just very poor. The song choice and song matter, but for Kelly, she should do better to keep something in the air tonight.

Last spring  rising hip hop artist  B.O.B. had a smash hit with the Bruno Mars assisted Nothing On You from B.O.B., Mars followed up that song with a equally successful single the Travie McCoy late summer hit Billionaire. On the heels of a possible jail sentence, we now have Bruno Mars debut album. Unlike hook singers Bruno decided to release his album while the iron was hot.
1. Grenade - This is a rock influenced song where Bruno's vocals seem to go with beat very naturally. Mr. Mars even sings some of the riffs similar to the late MJ. *** out of ****
2. Just The Way You Are - The lead single which is straight bubble gum pop. I'm a grown man so this song didn't really appeal to me but once again the vocals are good. *** out of ****
3. Our First Time - I was waiting for a slow jam from Mr. Mars and this is one of the few on the CD. The arrangement reminds me of something that Robin Thicke would do. **** out of ****.
4. Runaway Baby - As I soon as I heard the production on the song, I knew I wouldn't like it. Bruno gives one of his worst vocals on this track and it sounds like something Ricky Martin would have done back in 1999. * out of ****.
5. The Lazy Song - Listening to this track, I got the feeling Bruno just wanted to have a humorous song on his disc. Just as the title implies this is a lazy song. ** out of ****.
6. Marry You - I'm not really a rock fan but while listening to this song I did find myself tapping my feet and I could easily see this song being sung on an episode of Glee in a Will & Emma fantasy sequence. *** out of ****
7. Talking To The Moon - Finally we have a track on par with Our First Time. I could easily relate to the message in the song about being away from a loved one.
8. Liquor Store Blues (Feat. Damian Marley) - The production on this track was a little weak but the Damian Marley cameo saves it. *** out of ****.
9. Count On Me - Count Of Me is a folk inspired ballad similar to something Jason Marz might be. If he doesn't go to jail and with a great band backing him, this song will sound great live. ****
10. The Other Side (Feat Cee Lo Green & B.o. B) - The last song on the album gets some cool points since it's refreshing just to hear Cee Lo sing. *** out of ****

Overall this isn't a horrible debut album, it is a mediocre album.  I thought for sure that Bruno would go for a straight R&B album with top notch production, instead he's given us a Jason Marz sounding album.  Bruno has a naturally smooth falsetto voice and while he couldn't handle to other falsetto's singers like El Debarge or Ralph Tresvant, the weak production on this disc hurts Bruno more than it helps. Given that Bruno is a fan of doo-wop I have to wonder why he didn't enlist the production of Raphael Saadiq who had an amazing album with the Motown inspired The Way I See It . If Bruno wants to have a longer career in the music industry he'll need to come a little stronger next time or his career could end up like Nate Dogg's.",Weak Debut From A Singer Capable Of More,1286323200,

Side project is in quotes because only part of me believes the Chicks will record again and that this is really the new full-tine gig of sisters Emily Robison and Martie Maguire.

While talented in their own right - both sisters are very accomplished multi-instrumentalists and songwriters - they do lack a certain spark that Natalie Maines brought to the trio as their vocalist.  And overall, I'm being nice.

CYH is kind of snooze of an album.  It has all the right intentions and a lot of talent, but like I said, no spark.

With all due respect to the sisters, they were wise to hire a lead singer of Maines' capabilities.  There is a reason the sisters sing harmony and backing vocals.  While fully capable singers, there is nothing distinctive about what they do here.  There are hundreds of female vocalists already out there who sing with mediocrity (""April's Love"", ""Skyline"", ""Fear of Wasted Time"", ""Well Behaved"", etc).  Too add insult to injury, they pick the least charismatic collaborator when having Jakob Dylan duet on one song.  He doesn't even compliment the lead vocal.

There are a few songs that have the right idea, but aren't quite there - like ""Delight (Something New Under the Sun)"", that you can't think if Maines were taking the lead vocals, it would work.

And then there are ones that are a slight notch above that where they make an attempt for something above a pulse, or a chart position: ""The Coast"", ""I Miss You"".

I do like ""Ain't No Son"". The CHY finally kick it up, but you can't help but wonder how out of the park it could/would have been with Maines singing this.  Still, had more of the disk been like this song, it would have been a worthy purchase.

No, it further obfuscates the story with long instrumental interludes that are all over the place in style.

It's not just the instrumentation on these songs, but it is also Sudol's vocal delivery.  It goes between whisper/spoken and grating falsetto with too much vibrato.  It's not until ""Avalanches (Culla's Song)"" that longtime fans will find something that sounds like what they are expecting.  The only other songs that resemble A Fine Frenzy's sound are ""Sailingsong"" and ""Now Is The Start"".  However, it would be inaccurate to say that this is all there is to Pines - but not necessarily in a good way.  If you fancy generic dance pop, then look no further than ""It's Alive"".  That is an ironic way to arrive at saying that Pines is the musical equivalent of Frankenstein's monster.  While it was intended to be high concept, it comes off as a collection of ill-fitting random parts.

His last album (2008's Year of The Gentleman) was extremely successful despite being just an average album, but Libra Scale is lacking in both areas. It flopped and was his worst album by far. The production was weak (I don't recognize hardly any names on this album), the songwriting was bland, and just the overall vibe of the album was boring. There were a few standout cuts, the mellow baby maker ""Telekinesis"" and the mid tempo banger ""Makin a Movie"" both make lasting impressions, as do the singles ""Champagne Life"" and ""One in a Million"", but other than that the rest of the album is filler in my opinion. That was the biggest problem with this album, was there was a severe lack of standout material on the album, and it just didn't sound focused at all, kind of coming off half assed.

To use the title of one of their tunes from the Goats album, Black and Blue continued the mid-70s trend of the Rolling Stones ""Coming Down Again"" from the glorious heights of their '68-'72 Classic peaks. B&B is simply an uneven, if not amateurish performance, by a group touted as World's Greatest ROCK & ROLL Band.

This album has much more of a NON-rock & roll style. ""Hot Stuff"" is funky; reggae is evident with ""Cherry Oh Baby""; and ""Melody"" is a little jazzy. Tellingly, only one song from B&B managed to (barely) crack the US Top Ten, and wasn't even a Rock and Roll number (Fool to Cry).

No, this can arguably be considered a low point in the Stones' output from the '70s, especially considering that Ron Wood was still testing out his wings here as a new band member. The album DID manage to score some notable PR for the infamous Hollywood billboard in which a Jagger-bound young model was shown to say

""I'm BLACK AND BLUE from the Rolling Stones -- and I love it!""

The resulting firestorm from feminist groups probably added to sales of the album, despite the mediocrity of the tracks. The lads from London thus continued their notorious streak of controversy for being ""Bad Boys.""

One last thing....

Just wanted to make some corrections on reviewer Jarchow's comment ""Billy Preston -- who by the way is the ONLY musician to have played on both a Beatles recording, and a Stones recording""

Technically incorrect.

-- The incomparable English pianist Nicky Hopkins played on numerous Stones' recordings, and on one or more Beatles recordings (e.g., ""Revolution"" from the White Album).

-- Guitar great Eric Clapton played lead ax on The Beatles ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps,"" and recorded with Keith Richards and John Lennon on the tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus in 1968.

More technically correct, but still historically interesting, are the following:

-- One of the Stones played on a Beatles recording. Appropriately, this was Rolling Stones founder and talented multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who played alto saxophone on the B side of the Beatles' last single ""Let it Be."" The recording is a comedy-lounge tune called ""You Know My Name (look up the number)."" Jones was part of the recording sessions with the Beatles in early April 1967 for this composition.

-- One of the Beatles played on a Stones recording. That honor goes to none other than John Lennon, who jammed with Keith Richards (and Clapton, as mentioned above) on the Beatles tune ""Yer Blues"" for the Stones' 1968 Circus.

-- Head Stones Jagger and Richards joined the Beatles in recording their 1967 release ""All You Need is Love.""

His songs like Hero and Could I Have This Kiss Forever with Whitney Houston, really were driven and had strong chemistry with his fans. But that strength has been weakened with his latest single which also was featured on the likeness from the Jersey Shore fan base with I Like It, from his latest album Euphoria. I really felt that it just was him trying to prove his dance beats to a new generation of fans was one step too far. It just was just as lackluster as his last album, 7 had shown in his voice. I honestly think Enrique should take a deep look at himself and see what he should do next for his next single, and even for his choice of finding better material for his next record.

This stuff is pass, but as I was saying, once you dip your feet into the soundscapes of Aphex Twin type electronic ambient and effects type stuff, you might just go there all the way and get rid of the singing. And you'll end up at Boards of Canada and that type of stuff, even The Orb, and then onto John Hopkins. I'm surprised people aren't tired of Yorke's whining.

It is quite the experimental pop/rnb affair, hardly a hip hop album to be correct. Cudi is in typical form lamenting, crowing, and going on in that jazzy, stylistic way of his about his mental separation from society. When he is not singing and besides the one rapping verse on the album, large swaths of intergalactic instrumentals mellow out the proceedings.

This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case in this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or ""Capitol Steps""/""SNL""/""Mad TV"" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, and weak.  For ""My Husband Sleeps Tonight"", a parody of the cringey oldie ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"".  That almost defeats the purpose.
Most men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, testy temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children.
For the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's ""Rutland Weekend Television"", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.

Stay, the third single from her Unapologetic record feels like a sad song, but she doesn't put out there as much from her voice as she could have.

3,3.0,True,"11 20, 2015",A3AL8GQ69QE7WN,B013D1FONK,{'Format:': ' MP3 Music'},Jason Stein,"Like most Americans, I was first learned of Bryan Adams in 1983 via MTV and the videos for ""Straight From The Heart"", ""Cuts Like A Knife"" and ""This Time"". As a 10 year old I didn't really know what to think of Bryan Adams. I mean, just look at all the other artists crowding MTV at the time, and then there's Bryan Adams. The following year, ""Reckless"" would dominate. ""Run To You"" began airing November 1984 and the hits just kept coming with ""Somebody"", ""Heaven"", ""Summer Of '69"", ""One Night Love Affair"" and ""It's Only Love"". I was saturated with Bryan Adams for the rest of my living days. 1987's ""Into The Fire"" didn't fare well. Perhaps Americans were tired of Adams. Burned out. ""Heat Of The Night"", ""Hearts On Fire"" and ""Victim Of Love"" didn't really possess the staying power, and I think Adams retreated, only to come roaring back in 1991 with ""Waking Up The Neighbors"" and another barrage of hits from ""(Everything I Do) I Do It For You"", ""Can't Stop This Thing We Started"", ""Thought I'd Died And Gone To Heaven"" and ""Do I Have To Say The Words?"". Enough, overkill, and then the ballads kept coming with 1993's ""All For Love"" and then ""Please Forgive Me"" and then ""Have You Really Ever Loved A Woman?"" Nail in coffin, goodnight.

And that's just it, isn't it? I've always thought of Adams as a singles man, not an album man. His albums have so much filler, and guess what, even ""Get Up"" has that filler too. Adams hasn't had a top 40 hit since ""Here I Am"" from ""Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron"" back in 2002 (in America at least). I don't think Adams enjoys America too much since he's been burned at the stake here for 1996's ""18 Til I Die"" and 1998's ""On A Day Like Today"" (both mediocre albums with some good songs).

So, you would think that Adams, along with songwriting veteran partner Jim Vallance, and in the producer's chair, Jeff Lynne of ELO, that ""Get Up"" would be instant magic, right? Wrong. Here's the deal. ""Get Up"" is only nine songs, which is great, except for the filler like ""Go Down Rockin'"" ""We Did It All"", ""Don't Even Try"" and ""Yesterday Was Just A Dream"". Come on, admit it, those are the weakest tracks here. The other five are pretty good, but sound like ELO with Bryan Adams. Even Jeff Lynne's help couldn't fix Adams' and Vallance's weak songwriting habits.

Do yourself a favor, just buy Adams' two disc ""Anthology"" from 2005. It has everything you'd want from Adams all in one neat package. Then, you can add select tracks from 2008's ""11"" and ""Get Up"" and you're done. Although, there are a few other album tracks I'd add like ""East Side Story"" from 2004's ""Room Service"" or ""Into The Fire"", ""Victim Of Love"", ""Another Day"" and ""Native Son"" from 1987's ""Into The Fire"".

The problem with 56 year old Adams is that he refuses to experiment much. He staunchly, almost defiantly, stands on middle of the road rock/pop/balladry. In fact, only 1987's ""Into The Fire"" showed any signs of Adams willing to stretch a bit more musically and lyrically.

So here's how ""Get Up"" compares to Adams other works:

What can I say, I need some edges on which to hang my hat ... so it wasn't until the song ""Papercut"" drifted from my speakers, that I had a sense that Tift Merritt actually had something to say, and in a manner that held my attention.  Believe me, it's fine for songs to be etherial, but they need to be memorable, otherwise this is just an album to slip off to on a Sunday morning when you're trying to shield your eyes from the sun as it creeps in through the blinds.

Others have compared Tift to Sheryl Crow, though she dances on the indy side of the scales.  I once heard Tift in an interview saying that she never really says what she means ... and folks I tell you, it shows.  Sure, this is a very intimate album, at least it was designed to be, it has a really nice opening track ""Mixtape,"" but for the most part See You On The Moon doesn't go anywhere, nor does it allow your imagination to take you anywhere, other then setting the stage for a reflective somber morning about life in general.  In another interview Tift said that she has always subscribed to the less is more attitude ... and that shows as well ... excluding the tracks ""Mixtape,"" and ""Papercut,"" where she subscribes to the more is better philosophy, and has something to say in an exciting manner, lifting the vail of obscurity, and revealing the two finest songs of her career.

They have been more severely overexposed by rap and hip hop, which has really lagged at real diversity over the recent years. For female R&B groups, they have also not been showing their soul either with that diversity. SWV had been absent from making music for quite awhile and went away after the 90's ended. They did return in 20111 with I Missed Us which did very well. But their latest single doesn't actually show the same bark strike from the apple tree. Their latest single M.C.E. (Man Crush Everyday) tries to go back to basics for them, as they sample the late Michael Jackson with his classic Lady In My Life from the Thriller record. This is something SWV definitely did much better over twenty years ago, when they sampled Human Nature for the trio's hit Right Here. The song is alright, but not anything to sneeze about. I hope the gals can come up with something more brilliant than this one showed.

All I can say is this is a big disappointment. I listen to music to emotionally engage with and I find this to be soulless and dull. The reliance on boring drum machine programs (mixed way too far forward on some tracks) and dull unimaginative bass lines make for a very plodding, leaden feel. I am all for modern artists to explore retro styles, but in this case but it all sounds pretty bland and derivative.
The synth melodies are OK in places, and there are a couple of tracks that are a pleasant listen, but overall there is nothing that makes me want to play this again, let alone agree it is album of the year.

During this five year absence, Rob made two feature films, so it was questionable if he would ever return to music, or just focus on his movie career full time. But now his fans can rejoice because Rob has finally returned with a new studio album.

""Educated Horses"" keeps the b-side/horror movie samples to a minimum, so it may very well be the most focused and professional album of Rob's long and storied career. Plus, as songs like the churning ""American Witch,"" and the rhythmic ""17 Year Locust"" show, Rob still knows his way around a good hook. And there are a handful of standout tracks on here. ""The Scorpion Sleeps"" features a catchy stop-start beat with stutter-stepping guitars; songs like ""Let It All Bleed Out"" and ""Ride"" are backed by a powerful chug and churn guitar lead; and ""Death Of It All"" has a beautiful acoustic guitar intro/outro and an unexpected, hooky hand-clap pattern.

But, unfortunately, ""Educated Horses"" has just as many drawbacks as good aspects. Firstly, there are no classics anywhere on here, and no songs that are anywhere near as good or memorable as, say, ""Dragula,"" ""Living Dead Girl,"" or ""Never Gonna Stop."" It's doubtful that any of ""Educated Horses"" will stick with you or bounce around your head for very long.

Next, this is doubtlessly Rob's most experimental and least heavy album. The single, ""Foxy Foxy,"" has a syncopated beat and digitized/electronic vocals, whereas songs like the aforementioned ""17 Year Locust"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" feature (what could be) a sitar. Experimentation isn't inherently a bad thing, but most would agree that heavy songs are catchier, more infectious, more exciting/exhilarating, and hold the listener's attention better.

Finally, the biggest flaw this C.D. has is that, like most RZ discs, ""Educated Horses"" is WAY too short. At a mere 11 tracks (with only nine of those being actual songs) and 39 minutes, it doesn't have time to be to wow the listener or be a satisfying step forward from ""Sinister Urge."" It's curious that it took Rob this long to make a C.D. that's this brief.

So, there are a few good tunes here, but, as a whole, ""Educated Horses"" just kind of falls flat and isn't memorable. In fact, it's probably Rob Zombie's weakest album (that he's made by himself or with White Zombie). If you're not a diehard fan who needs a complete collection, you can definitely afford to skip this one or buy it used.","Not bad, but definitely not Rob's best",1143590400,

He's like the male equivalent of Nicki Minaj.  If you want a slick vocal to lace your chorus lines, you call Mars (just like if you want a catchy female rapper to spice up your remix you call Minaj).

`Doo-Wops & Hooligans' marks Mars' solo effort.

There is no denying that Bruno Mars has a beautifully toned voice.  His vocals are crisp and smooth and delightful to listen to.  From the show he made with select radio singles, Mars wet our appetite and got us hooked with his hooks.  We wanted to hear more.  Sadly, this debut album doesn't really deliver 100 percent.  In fact, it leaves a lot to be desired.

It's kind of mediocre.

In a nutshell, I still love `Just The Way You Are'; it's a beautiful yet simple take on love and I fell for it immediately.  `Grenade' almost feels like the dark side to the first single.  The construction is similar, just more intense.  I like the song, although I must admit that the lyrical content on the chorus can be a tad obvious, which I'm not really a fan of.  It's like `lyrics 101'; very amateur writing.  His conviction though, is very convincing.  `Count on Me' sounds like a Jason Mraz song.  It has a bouncy and catchy vibe.  It's a little cheesy in parts (well, almost all parts) but it will get you swaying to the beat and it's a sweet song.  I know that `Marry Me' is all sorts of ridiculous cheesiness, but I totally adore it.  Maybe it has something to do with the whole `Glee' take on it last week, but I just swallow that track up with nothing short of wholehearted affections.

`Talking to the Moon' is a sweet ballad, but it lacks any real punch to make it wholly memorable.  His voice sounds great, but it doesn't `pop' aesthetically.  `The Lazy Song' is just stupid.  It isn't really funny or witty; it's just lazy and amateur.  I mean, aside from the sexual connotation, it seems like a children's song, like commercialized Smash Mouth.  To say I hate the song would be an understatement.  `Runaway Baby' is fun and stands out because of the audaciousness of it all.  It has a spunky and vibrant vibe, so I thoroughly enjoy it, even if the lyrics seem contradictory.

I know `Our First Time' is supposed to be seductive and sexy but it's rather bland and boring.

The vampire craze hit Mars, so he closed his album with `The Other Side' where he enlists the help of `it-man' Cee-Lo Green and that mediocre flash in the pan known as B.o. B. to help him spit a few verses about convincing some chick to convert to vampirism.  Um, it's a decent track when all is said and done.  It's catchy and stylish, but there is something missing from it.  `Liquor Store Blues' is just weird.  I mean, reggae is not something you just `mess' with.

It just doesn't work.

So, in the end the album is just kind of `meh'.  I mean, I like some of the songs and then I actually love two or three of them, but overall the feeling I get is one of being increasingly under-whelmed, so I can't say that I really recommend this album as a whole.

His debut album came out in 1985, and I got it after seeing him on Friday Night Videos.  ....because I liked the music and he was dreamy.

Deep down, his music hasn't changed all that much and he is still dreamy.

He has a new disk out  - 'First Comes the Night'. For an extra $2, I got the DE-luxe model which has five more songs. I'm a marketer's dream. They see me coming a mile away.

Isaak certainly has a style, and while he's tweaked it here and there, it's never far off course from his origins. And while so many reviewers want to brand him as ""an Elvis"" and there is some of that here (""I Love the Way You Kiss Me""), but he is so much closer to ""a Roy Orbison"", yet still his own artist, his own style.

Recording in Nashville and using that cities musicians, it is hardly a ""country"" album, though Rolling Stone reviews it as such. But they are kind of idiots anyways. I will say there are other influences (""Running Down the Road""  -  Jerry Lee Lewis, but mostly the keyboards, not the vocals).

Like all Isaak albums, 'First Comes the Night' is fraught with heartache, loneliness, melancholy - everything that Isaak is known for. As always most of it works, some of it doesn't. Well, about half of it works.

I love the title track - though when he sings 'wherever you are' followed by 'you're here in my....' I always assume he'll say 'car', because it rhymes more than 'heart' does. Weeks later, and I'm still going with 'car'.

Most likely, the best song is ""Reverie"". Sure, it starts out with the piano from the Lisa Kudrow show, Web Therapy (which possibly stole it from Suzanne Vega's ""Pornographer's Dream""), but it is the song I enjoy most on the disk.

A close follow-up is ""Kiss Me Like a Stranger"", that would not be out of place if the Mavericks had covered it - with horns. But I always found Raul Malo and Isaak to be closer in style than most people probably notice.  I dog ""Dry Your Eyes"",  and ""Perfect Lover"" (really Mavericks material!),

And oddly, the ""bonus"" tracks are good. Normally, artists who don't have them on the standard album, they tend to be throwaway songs. But four of the five are better than some stuff on the normal disk.

There are things here that don't work - in my opinion: ""Baby, What Do You Want Me to Do"".  The plucking of violin strings seems out of place, but the vocal arrangement seem to compete with the musical arrangement. ""Insect"" is not bad, but it is not over the top good.

While I appreciate Isaak trying to shake things up with the Nashville routine and normally I'd say maybe working with other songwriters strays from who he is, but all the songs I like were co-writes. Maybe the need for three producers made the album less cohesive, I don't know.

Don't get me wrong - 'First Comes the Night' is by no means a bad disk, but it is not Chris Isaak's best work either.","Good, but not his Best",1448409600,

While there have been acts that have been more about hyppe, and less of heart and soul like Jennifer Lopez, who hasn't really been a credible singer lately, or Ricky Martin, who hasn't really made an English pop album in years who just made everyone say they were Livin' La Vida Loca so much, others made it because of their family bonds. That was the case with Enrique Iglesias. His family has had a enormous career with singing because of the triumphs of his father Julio, and his sibling Julio Iglesias Jr., who has a moderate career in English a few years ago. But, it is hard to believe that it has been nearly 10 years, and Enrique has been the last Latin crossoverof the 90's act standing today. Now, his English music career is celebrated with a new hits collection.

Enrique Iglesias 2008 Greatest Hits, is a single disc reflection of his biggest ballads and seducing women to dance, that spans his 1st decade of success. The collection is noble, and a simple reintroduction to what he has brought to the table. The songs have all been remastered well, and include his boldest songs. All the hits are here from his seductive dance smashes like Bailamos and Rhythm Divine, to his intimate ballads such as Hero and the overlooked and seductive Could I Have This Kiss Forever with Whitney Houston. There are a few new songs here that really lack a bit of chemistry though, that miss the mark by a longshot including Away with Sean Garrett, and Takin' back My Love with Ciara, which feels like it is lacking soul and heart. That is something you haven't yet heard from Enrique, and that makes the new songs feel more like a turnoff than a starter for love and games in bed.

Still, despite those new tracks which feel more like a drag than seductive starters, Enrique Iglesias Greatest Hits isn't a bad buy for hard core fans, but mostly could've had a bit more for those who haven't yet heard any of his standards at all. While it isn't a bad purchase, I just was honestly hoping for a bit more to say that the rhythm was more divine to.

That exigency is the foundation of hip-hop as well as the nature of life in the 'hood which propels this genre of music. After a couple of albums and artist success, most rappers tend to relax, which often affects their music. It's understandable that Ortiz would reach a point where he needs to catch his breath, hence the title and tone of this album. After all, he's been rapping like his life depends on it ever since he emerged in the game. Add that to the fact that he's made lifestyle changes (refraining from alcohol and cigarettes, working-out, weight loss), it's understandable that his music will reflect upon his personal growth. This release includes a few R&B tracks previously non-existent within his catalogue, not to mention some jazz influenced production. However, these tracks are a mixed bag of weak to solid. The Joell Ortiz that I dig is the cat who rips mics with supreme lyricism. Although he's lyrically sharp throughout this project, the initial missteps on the disc (""Cold World"" ""Dream On"" ""Brothers Keeper"") are disruptive head scratchers.

Ive really enjoyed much of their work including their last release Rise but theres something brewing that I don't like and Unleashed displays it: John Coopers singing is dominating all the songs. The band doesnt take long enough to let any of these songs breathe and develop so they all end up sounding really, really similar; really formulaic. And its sounding old. I realize that Skillet is a modern rock band who has always placed a lot of emphasis on a lot of vocals and I like Coopers voice (most of the time) but too much sometimes is just thattoo much. I think that this album is an example of that and it reminds me of Creeds last release (Full Circle) where pretty early on I wanted Scott Stapp to stop singing so I could listen to the music (mind you, I like Stapps vocals). While Unleashed doesnt sink down to quite that level it gets close and I wish the songs were more interesting, more musically developed, and that Cooper would hold back and let the music sit on its own more or that he and drummer Jen Ledger would share vocals more than they do. This at least helps change up the dynamics between songs and helps make the album as a whole more listenable. As such I Want To Live is one of the albums better songs IMO both for the male/female vocals and for the symphonic music. Stars and Lions may be my favorite songs off this release and they are more synth dance songs than rock songs. Meanwhile songs like Feel Invincible, Back From the Dead, Undefeated, and especially tracks Out of Hell and Burn It Down generate the my main criticisms. So all Im saying is that I want to see them break away from the mold (stadium anthems) and play around an album throughout its track list. Their last great album was Collide.

Last summer had its share of good music as always, and we at least had a little variety on the radio. Enter, Fergie, the seemingly sex-crazed double-entree singer who sung about her humps, and London Bridge, and a myriad of other metaphors. But this time, instead of doing that stuff, it's a breakup song, with acoustic guitar, and only the hint of a beat.

The lyrics aren't too bad, pretty simple, with hints of 'where did that come from?' Such as, ""We'll play jacks and uno cards."" The verses are overall OK, nothing to brag about, and the vocals lack in some parts. However, the chorus comes out strong, and it and the acoustic guitar really make this a good song.

So overall, a good song, not a great one. A great change for Fergie, and definitely her best song by far, Black Eyed Peas or not. But in terms of getting this song, I wouldn't buy it, but I'd get it by other means if you know what I mean.",Fergie's Best Isn't That Great,1205884800,

Sorrow, for the band has parted ways with guitarist Sonny Mayo not even a week prior to the album's release. Hope, however, that with original guitarist Clint Lowery back in the fold, that the band will stop rushing out albums so quickly and take their time to put out a stunning chapter eight.

Truth is, listening to Sevendust is like getting together with old friends. There's a certain sense of comfort, of knowing what to expect. More or less, Sevendust haven't drastically altered their sound over the years. Each album has been marked with a significant growth, but not enough to turn off the fanbase. It should come as no surprise, then, that ""Chapter VII: Hope & Sorrow"" -- rushed out 13 months after ""Alpha"" -- has the band going through the motions. Usually, with two years between albums, any band can come up with something that is both satisfying and refreshing. Being the first time Sevendust have released two albums so closely together, it is also the first time they have fallen short of expectations.

That's not to say that their seventh effort is a bad one. It's a totally listenable album, especially for the faithful fan, but there is nothing here that hasn't been done already on the previous six efforts. It's got a strong start with the intense ""Inside"" -- which would make a perfect set opener for their upcoming tour -- and songs like ""Hope"" and the groovy first single, ""Prodigal Son,"" stray from the ""Alpha"" formula, turning out to be the most interesting tracks. In fact, the main problem with this album is that it's basically ""Alpha"" redux. Had they taken more time to tour with that album and record this material, we might have something a little more interesting to listen to. Then again, if they had waited, Sonny wouldn't have gotten his part in this, his closing chapter with the band. But I digress.

In an attempt to up the ante (and perhaps have a bid at rock radio success) the help of American Idol's Chris Daughtry and Alter Bridge's Miles Kennedy and Mark Tremonti is enlisted. Tremonti's contribution to ""Hope"" is definitely a highlight, but Miles and Daughtry both seem to have trouble meshing with Lajon's vocal style. These collaborations have nothing on the likes of Skin, Chino Moreno or even Aaron Lewis, and each respective singer tends to overpower their song. Definitely a downer.

Yet, she hasn't had a really strong set of songs which was well widely accepted with Funhouse. But it has been a decade since Pink embarked her own success after conquering physical and emotional abuse from drugs and her parents divorce. But her latest songs isn't her biggest slice of the pie. Raise Your Glass, the lead single from Pink's upcoming greatest hits album isn't a song that really stood out like her bigger songs had shown. While the song isn't a bad song, but not anything really over the top from her. While it is sure to please die hard Pink fans, it just wasn't anything really to rave about. Hopefully, Pink can have some new fans to raise their glass on this one.

Fab's rap style is still very much there and intact, and much emphasis is placed on the man's personal feelings and experiences. A few moments spread positive messages, namely reaching high, moving on and healthy fathering (""Young OG II""), and even when Fabolous is critical and distrustful of ne'er-do-wells and his detractors, he has a great sense of karma, doling out just deserts, rarely sounding cruel, cold or cynical. His tried and true capo-style comes out in lines about bad b*tches, posh fashion, the ""gun shop"" and his ""shooters,"" but he has left out the dope-dealing aspects, probably for the better. Appropriate for the season, ""Ball Drop"" celebrates starting the new year afresh by severing toxic relationships. Fab's intentions for this album were ""90s inspired and themed"" and nothing exemplifies the influence more than all the famous hip hop samples, quotes, name-drops and sound bites tossed in the mix. They have a strong New York-hip hop flavor to them and pay homage to Jay-Z, Nas and the Notorious B.I.G. especially. The music production as a whole, which is supplied by a melange of great producers, is cool and chill but even Fabolous can't escape the ubiquitous drill beat of modern-age trap. Truth be told, from the right vantage point, they're actually quite tasteful. Aside from Fabolous, The Young OG Project features some talented, new rappers and singers instead of veteran artists from Fab's heyday, giving it a fresh, up to date feel (no disrespect to the rap game's vets). Young OG may not be Loso's Way 2, but it's traditional Fabolous with a contemporary twist. It has all the fabulous musical style, quality lyricism and urban, street flourishes that fans have come to expect from the Brooklyn emcee.","Fabolous criticizes haters, embraces inner role model in 'The Young OG Project'",1419552000,

She can sing and she can act, so when i got wind of a definite release date on her debut, I was soooo excited. I got over the fact that they wasted a track on rehashing the song from Dreamgirls. If they really wanted to blow me away, they should've made it a duet with her and Jennifer Holliday, no holds barred singing either.  Spotlight grew on me and I ended up singing it around the house when there was no music playing at all. I got over the album cover and I got over her fake forced laugh at 106 and that sudden engagement to a reality tv star (not her boyfriend since high school). This girl has chops but when it came to the album, the material wasn't as strong. It reminded of not only the ""too-much hype"" theory but also it sounded like a record by an artist who didn't have good material to work with which seems to be more the cause of first class divas that have been around a long time (Patti Labelle, albums in the 90's). Pocketbook is a really good jam but came off like a ""we've got to put a hood jam on here"". Some of the songs came off to Idol-y to me, She could've did better without T-Pain instead getting a more capable male duet singer like Babyface, Jahiem or Raheem Devaughn who can rift and melisma like no other male singer. The whole vocal machine thing is tired; Only Zapp can pull that off and do it well, and maybe Teddy Riley. She did really good on ""Jesus Has A Home For Me Over There"" but she didn't blow me away. She was pretty underwhelming on the Diane Warren song. However, the song she did with Fantasia is on point; That was one of few highlights on the album and I think if she did an entire album around that sound of old school r&b, she would have gotten a solid 5. It had that ""Woman 2 Woman"" feel to it and Fantasia is the only other female artist that can hold her own against Jennifer. It still gives me chills.

The vocals are the same as always for Bedingfield. The music itself is typical modern music, take it or leave it, although my description is a bit vague.

Springfield's cover versions are somewhat bland and vary little from the originals. It's a bit disappointing that Springfield doesn't attempt to update these songs (to avoid some dated 80's elements) or add any new twists on these songs. A re-imagining or unique spin on these songs would be expected, as that is traditionally the point of a covers album.

That being said, the songs sound nice and it's interesting to hear his vocals on these songs. You'll be able to sing along to every song from the start, since nothing about these arrangements differ from their original versions.

If you're a die-hard Springfield fan, it's worth purchasing just to hear his vocals on these songs. But don't expect any breakthroughs. Honestly, this album either feels like a ""filler"" album (to meet contractual requirements) or an attempt to recapture 80's-era fans (i.e. the ""Jessie's Girl"" crowd) who were were turned off by the grungy Shock/Anger/Denial/Acceptance album that proceeded this.  If you're more a fan of Springfield's work from Tao or Karma, you might be a bit disappointed in this album for its lack of creativity or anything that reflects Springfield's unique pop/rock style.

THE DISC: (2006) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 44 minutes. Included with the disc is a 14-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times (no lyrics), band pictures, and thank you's. This is album #2. Recorded at Studio At The Palms (Las Vegas). Label - Island Records.

COMMENTS: I wanted to love ""Sam's Town"" (named after a 9-story Vegas hotel and casino built in 1979). The Killers' 1st album, ""Hot Fuss"" (2004), was such an incredible album... I ran out and bought ""Sam's Town"" based on the strength of their debut. ""Hot Fuss"" had hit after catchy hit and garnered the band tons of accolades - most notably an American Music Award, a Billboard Music Award and a Grammy nomination. While ""Sam's Town"" has grown on me, it still lacks that, um...  punch. I would be surprised if this album won any of the above mentioned awards. There's no brilliant songs like ""Mr. Brightside"", ""Somebody Told Me"" or ""Smile Like You Mean It"" here. No need to compare their 1st and 2nd albums... they're vastly different. Having waited to fully digest this disc, I've come away with the feeling that this is more like a swashbuckling theatrical soundtrack than a rock/alternative album... something Freddy Mercury (R.I.P.) would have really appreciated. It's up, it's down, happy, sad, rock, pop and downright weird (just like some of the classic Queen albums). ""Sam's Town"" has several good tracks on it... ""When You Were Young"" (hit #18 on the pop charts, but fell quickly after 2 weeks), ""Bones"" (their next hit), and ""Read My Mind"". There's also some nice piano and acoustic moments on the ""enterlude"" and ""exitlude"". The rest is downright average, with some songs being utterly forgettable. I've read reviews here on Amazon as well as some of the well-known music mags and ""Sam's Town"" is a mixed bag at best (and I agree)... Rolling Stone Magazine (2 stars out of 5), All Music Guide (3 stars out of 5), Blender (4 out of 5), and Spin (3 out of 5). Billboard shows the unit sales dropping from week 1 (315,000 units) to week 2 (102,000 units) to week 3 (62,000 units)... a steady decline can't be a good thing.

3,36.0,False,"11 5, 2013",A3S9IDI1V2WQQ1,B00EWS5IO4,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Matthew Z. Pierce,"This is a review of ""Miami pop festival"" the Jimi Hendrix experience. I liberated a copy of this CD from a local big box store tonight, before it's true release. So I have listened to it twice and here is my take: for $9.99, this is a three star purchase. There is some interesting banter and a tuning session by Jimi, which showcases just how novel these large festivals were in the late 60s. This particular festival was set in May of 1968 and promoted by Michael Lang, of pre-Woodstock fame.

The songs on this live disc come mainly from ""Are You Experienced...?"" even though it's mid '68. The first track is a funny little whimsical 60s back and forth that descends into the tuning session referenced earlier.  Track two opens with a cool jam intro with punching kick drums from Mitch Mitchell and phased out feedback laden guitar from Jimi- just before launching into a nicely rearranged introduction of ""hey Joe."" The solo in this song really kicks. The next song, Foxy Lady, blasts off. The intro contains a whole lotta Uni-Vibe and phasing. One nice aspect is that the mixes, which were done originally by Kramer and then later remixed for this project by Eddie Kramer are tight.

 The next song ""Tax-free"" is a nice jam with some heavy crybaby floating throughout. Noel Redding's bass guitar is right up there in the mix in the correct place, sonically speaking. Mitch has a cool tempo altering drum solo that really starts swinging as Jimmy comes back in with some blistering wah-wah guitar. The on and off mic banter is amusing and entertaining, as it shows just how novel and inexperienced the promoters and the sound technicians were at setting up these kinds of shows in the early, nascent  stages of festival going.

 I will avoid the common bashing of Janie Hendrix and the whole experience Hendrix cash grab machine that so many complain about. What else can be said about this process? There is very limited material that Mr. Hendrix produced while he was alive. Most of it has already been heard many times over. We are scraping the bottom of the barrel, of course, ending up with products like ""Valleys of Neptune ""which was decent and acceptable and overall a good listen. So with all of that said, this is a decent product. In fact it is rather good for a live recording. The only problem is the lack of material. The fact that two songs are repeated is troubling.

The accompanying booklet with photographs that show Jimmy with his Olympic white Fender Strat are very nice and well done. The packaging is actually quite nice as well. So for $10, this is a marginal three-star buy. Put some other records ahead of it in your musical shopping list, like Paul McCartney's new album or even some of those dreaded repackagings of prior releases that I loathe. The only one I would say to avoid at all costs is The Band at the Academy of Arts (aka ""Rock of Aged""). That one is a great example of a lame cash grab. Sad for such an amazing group. Ive heard NOTHING good about it!

For her latest song though, it shows that can try to make a good song stand out, but it feels like it is flavor of the moment. Pocketful Of Sunshine, the title track and second single from her sophmore album feels a little more upbeat than the collaboration with Sean King on Love Like This, but it just doesn't unfortunately really feel like it has stood out to being definitive from Natasha and her unique lyrical style. I like the beat of the song, but I was hoping from a bit more soul into the lyrics. Hopefully, when she comes out with her next single, it will sound much better tahn just a pocketful of the moment.

It's an apt picture. The album strips away much of Nashville's contemporary bombast in favor of the relaxed country vibe of Kenny Chesney and Alan Jackson. The comparison is particularly close in the sunny satisfaction and road trip escape of ""Roll With it,"" the forthright statement of home-spun roots ""A Little More Country Than That,"" and multiple mentions of good times and simple pleasures. Corbin and his co-writers have pulled together a collection of love songs, both warm and broken-hearted, and link Chesney with Tom T. Hall by drawing a blue line from Memphis to Key West in ""This Far From Memphis."" There's a moving lyric of imagined nostalgia in ""Someday When I'm Old"" and the second-chance glimpsed in ""Let Alone You"" is illustrated with sharply observed everyday details.

A few of the songs are a bit close to their inspirations for comfort. ""Don't Ask Me `Bout a Woman"" rewrites the sentiment and mood of Brad Paisley's ""Waitin' on a Woman,"" and the sandy vacation of ""A Lot to Learn About Livin'"" is third-generation Jimmy Buffett by way of Kenny Chesney. Corbin's vocals are lightly drawled and producer Carson Chamblerlain counts out a variety of tempos that allow is singer to show off his emotional prowess as both a balladeer and mid-tempo honky-tonker. The album closes with the thoughtful ""Leavin' a Lonely Town,"" echoing the escapes and traps of Steve Earle's ""Guitar Town"" and Chris Knight's ""Oil Patch Town."" The sound is Nashville clean, but it's not slickly artificial; it's sophisticated in the manner of George Strait and others able to hang on to their country roots even as they embrace modern studio production. 3-1/2 stars, if allowed fractional ratings.

But anyway, the first time I ever heard of Gavin DeGraw was when I saw him on Last Call with Carson Daly (don't ask me why I was watching that). And his song ""Follow Through"" is pretty good, so I decided to see what his album, Chariot, was like.
There are some other good songs on here, like the title track and the song he has out now, ""I Don't Want to Be"". And when I looked at the lyrics to ""Meaning"", I said, ""Oh boy, not another we-are-the-world song."" But that song actually works pretty well. My favorite song on the album, though, would have to be the smooth ""More Than Anyone"".
As far as the rest of the songs go, they leave something to be desired, especially the filler track ""(Nice to Meet You) Anyway"". ""Chemical Party"" and ""Belief"" have rather stupid lyrics, and ""Just Friends"" is fine until Gavin says something about that her body fits him like a glove.
I don't really Chariot is worth ALL the hype, but it's still a nice album to play to pass the time.

Lyrically her songs comes off a bit contrived and lacking any bite or edge that artists such as Ani Difranco and Tori Amos consistently churn out with each album. What compelled me to buy ""Under Rug Swept"" was not the single ""Hands Clean"" but rather the plaintive acoustic ballad ""Utopia"". I just fell in love with the song. When I heard ""Surrendering"" on MTV2 over the past weekend, my curiousity was piqued even more. I decided right then and there that I would have to buy ""Under Rug Swept"" regardless of my thoughts on Alanis as an artist. Now that I have heard the entire album. The good news is that I can't say that I regret buying the cd because there are some excellent songs. The bad news is that the first two songs are just hideous for me to listen to. I just hate Alanis' screeching vocals on ""Narcissus"", and ""21 Things I Want In a Lover"" just came off sounding stupid lyrically. I have to skip those two tracks. ""Hands Clean"" isn't too bad. It is starting to grow on me but it certainly isn't one of my favorite tracks on this album. The material starts getting stronger and better right after ""Hands Clean"" I think, particularly starting with ""So Sexy"". The lyrics were a bit off-putting for me and came off somewhat cheesy but the melodies and the musicianship were great. ""Precious Illusions"" is another favorite track of mine. This time the lyrics were good as were the hooks and melodies. I think Alanis sounds much better when she isn't singing off the top of her lungs and rather low-key (for her that is) like in songs such as ""That Particular Time"" and ""Utopia"". Those were my favorite moments. Unlike Natalie Imbruglia's ""White Lilies Island"", I still remain unconvinced regarding Alanis Morisette's talents. This album was so spotty in various places I still remained convinced that she is just a mediocre artist but it doesn't mean that I think she is terrible, just mediocre at best. Nevertheless she has gotten off on the right foot with this album for me. I just hope that she can do better material than ""21 Things I Want in a Lover"" and ""Narcissus"".",Fairly good but flawed,1014681600,

Lil Wayne's feature surely had much to do with this choice of a single, though many flop singles in the past have shown that an artist doesn't necessarily equate to success.

Tapping into a vein of anti-hero, anti achievement misery that spoke volumes to the gen X slacker generation and promoted via an alternative couldn't-give-a-toss style reminiscent of the punk ethos the album was also blessed with evocative cover art that really caught the punters eye and was truly indicative of the sentiments contained within - and how often does that happen?

The entire package is well thought out, the production by Butch Vig and the band being adequate and while probably a product of it's budget more than anything else the fact that it suits the downhearted vibes so painfully evident in Kurt Cobains vocals actually works as a bonus. Other aspects of the construction of this album (see the Classic Albums release about this album if you possibly can - it's out on DVD) also speak of a well thought out plan. The megahit title track is the lead cut, then the mood is instantly dropped a couple of notches in the soupy thouth interesting In Bloom and the maudlin Come As You Are - three tracks that all have their own feel while still working in the same idiom. The guitar attack is insistant and the fuzzy style of it is so indicative of the underground movement, the punk movement and also the hard rock movement because given the heaviness of it this album wasn't going to convert people to liking hard music. No way, you pretty much had to already be predisposed to hard `n' heavy music to get into this.

As the album unfolds further we get the first of the lesser lights in Breed, which can be forgiven as it's followed by Lithium, another musically interesting tune that shambles along and uses the underlying vocal melody so indicative of much of what Kurt Cobain was about and is one of the tunes where his love of Beatlesque tunefulness is apparent. Polly, apparently one of the salient tracks of this album, has a couple of amusing couplets but ultimately always left me unmoved as it seems to me indicative of the shambling pointless side of the Cobains persona.

Territorial Pissings is anarcho-punk at it's best. The perfect song for when you want to listen to something incoherently angry. And if you've never felt that way your reading the wrong review!

The problem with this album becomes apparent at this point however as Drain You and Lounge Act are pretty anonymous. Stay Away has it's moments but isn't enough to pull side two (in oldspeak) out of the muck. On A Plain - well after listening to this album however many times over the years I still couldn't tell you what it sounds like. Not a great advert for the tune is it?

Something in the Way finishes the album off..... Eventually. And it evokes more of the same sort of anger-management-gone-wrong vibe of Territorial Pissings and the title track and as such must be rated a success.

All up in many respects this album is a success as art - something people such as myself who actually don't like the tunes much can still recognise as having some sort of purpose whether intended or accidental. It's also successful in that it's been seen as something of a watershed moment in the history of hard rock/heavy metal and whether it floats your boat or not that's an achievement. And in terms of making lots of money for everyone involved it was also pretty darn successful (trust me - it's shifted a few units...). Potential downsides are that the constant pessimism can be grating, the attempts at arty rear and internal cover graphics smack of indie rubbish, full lyrics not included which is a pity given they were marketed as having a message and the fact that the sad ending to Kurt Cobains story may tinge your impressions of the album as you hear him rail against life and the universe. And each man alone must rage against his fate indeed....",Establishment baiting litmus paper,1201046400,

It also serves as a fairly effective sequel  to Morgan's eleven-track Greatest Hits collection from 1995.  There are two  overlaps: her signature recording - the symphonic saga ""Something In Red"" -  and the pedestrian non-hit ballad ""Standing Tall.""  The latter tune should  have been dumped in favor of the pretty, top 5 charter ""Out Of Your Shoes""  (the only significant Morgan recording not found on either anthology).
  In the five years since her first collection, the honey-voiced Morgan's  track record at radio has become increasingly spotty.  Not surprising,  about half of the hits included here are recordings made before 1995 that  didn't make it onto the first set.  These include her hard-shufflin'  breakthrough single ""Trainwreck Of Emotion"" (choo-choo!), the toe-tapping  #1 ""We Both Walk,"" and the stirring confession ""He Talks To Me.""  They tend  to make more of an impact than the recent rousers ""Go Away"" or ""One Of  Those Nights Tonight"" and especially, her snoozy duets with ex-hubby Jon  Randall (""By My Side"") and Sammy Kershaw (""Maybe Not Tonight"").
  The five new recordings show a great diversity in both musical styles and  taste.  Morgan's stunning take on the Tammy Wynette classic ""Another Lonely  Song"" is a tribute in every sense of the word and probably her greatest  vocal performance to date.  Meanwhile, the rap-infested ""Whoop-de-do"" is  definitely her worst (Morgan has never sounded so inane).  The remaining  new efforts are a pair of pale ""Something In Red"" imitations (""To Get To  You,"" ""If I Cry"") and a live recording of the precious Sarah McLachlan hit  ""Angel.""  Those last three torchy recordings seem to signal the direction  Morgan wants to take her career in the future... what a shame.",Best of the Rest,961459200,

Kesler,"Clocking in at almost 90 minutes, Lucinda Williams delivers much too much material on this outing that is not first rate, material that should have been saved and reworked for something in the future ... or left on the cutting room floor.

All of that being said, the songs that Ive managed to live with are brilliant, often sounding lo-fi, etherial and dreamy, out of time and out of touch ... like searching the radio dial on a road trip, picking up a distant weak station signal that strains your ears to be heard, and then as you crest the mountain or come out of a tunnel, its gone.  Leaving you to consider going back, just to hear a bit more of the magic that sent midnight shivers running through your bones on the open road.

Lucinda is one of the few people who are writing songs from the heart anymore, writing solid songs of her personal emotional experiences, writing songs that linger, writing songs from a troubled life that ride comfortably in your back pocket, because who among us has not had those moments of weakness, and needs music like this to let us know that were not out here on our own, lost on the vastness of a deserted highway.

Mind you, there are those of you who will love the songs Ive chosen not to play, and thats the best part about listening to Lucinda Williams, she has so much to offer to so many people.  So pick what you like, or take it all ... me [?], Im keeping:

Dust, Death Came, Doors Of Heaven, Ghosts Of Highway 20, Bitter Memory, If My Love Could Kill, Faith & Grace ... variations of the others Ive heard before.

Sadly, I really found that there could've been more brought out from Mariah into the song. It seemed like Miguel brought out more to chew out Mariah Carey out of her own duet.

I like the song well enough, but it isn't something I'd play every day.

For Starters, The song is good, lyrically. However, Traci's vocals were auto-tuned during parts of the song.

If you listen to the rest of the album, she clearly doesn't need auto-tune. So Whoever's bright idea it was to auto-tune her vocals on this track - basically ruins the song.

On top of that, the song feels rushed. on Braxton Family Values, the show showed Traci recording this song and she kept yelling cut and doing several takes.

It is lacking some magic and life, and fails to  really deliver.  After each track, you wait for the next one to be a little  different but they all sound very similar.

That he himself is his own worst enemy. District 9 was an amazing directorial effort, but then Elysium and now Chappie seem to be landing with quite a thud. Another alarming thing is he has never quite stuck with one composer. Clinton Shorters District 9 was an obvious The Dark Knight temp mimic. And Ryan Amons effort on Elysium failed to amount to anything (with no fault to Ryan, all blame on Blomkamp). Amon was in fact supposed to be onboard Chappie, but as things happen in Hollywood, Blomkamp somehow managed to snag Hans Zimmer. Zimmer dove right in after Interstellar and crafted a score that is fresh in its own sonic identity but definitely echoes the chaotic shortcomings of another choppy Blomkamp mishap.

Blomkamp is in love with his native Johannesburg, and Zimmer had to enter that gritty and metallic sci-fi world that Blomkamp has created out of his South African hometown. Chappie is a very standard score in terms of structure. We are introduced to the setting and story, we get a theme for Chappie, we follow Chappie on his journey and it comes to an explosive and emotional climax. Very by the books narrative here, which is fine. Heres the good. The score feels as if it was built from the ground up, and it really absorbs you into the soundscape of the narrative. Chappies theme arrives in A Machine That Thinks And Feels. Its a simple theme that sounds like a music box toy or a lullaby. Its childlike only in the sense of its fragility, newness and innocence. Zimmer does a fantastic job crafting action builds later with that theme that echos most of the emotion of the score. And honestly, thats the heart of the score. Chappies theme is the emotional heart. It reminded me very much of New Orders score to the brilliant short film More from Mark Osbourne (whom Hans has scored two films for now, maybe not a coincidence?). Its all about innocence and that drive for happiness.

The bad here is the pulsing electronic dance style the music takes on. The pulsing loops at times can be abrasive and structured in a way where you want them to stop so you can breath and take in the music. I get that its meant to add a modern vibe and pulsing structure to the action, but it yanks the listener out. Thankfully those loops become a more organic part of the score as the story moves forward and don't feel so artificial. I really liked the final act, it was true to Chappies emotional journey and delivered some great Zimmer moments. While the electronic textures used feel unique, Zimmer fans will notice some Dark Knight Rises elements (including a Bane-like chant) as well as an overall throwback sound that calls back to Thelma & Louise and Black Rain. In the end, the score saves itself from its hairy beginning. This isn't top shelf Zimmer, and I attribute that to a disconnect with Blomkamp who seems to have been given carte blanche too early in his career without fine-tuning his skills as a director.

Chappie is a score that may take at least two listens before it grows on you. The pulse-pounding beginning is too abrasive at times, and the mish-mash of electronic textures can get too muddled. Luckily once Chappies theme comes into play the score finds its footing and is able to craft an engaging enough narrative that excites just a tad more than it emotionally resonates. Zimmer with additional composers Steve Mazzaro and Andrew Kawczynski do craft a unique electronic soundscape for Blomkamps Chappie. Sometimes the stylistic approach drowns out the emotional core, but overall its an engaging and satisfying musical narrative by the end of it.",At Times Stylistically Abrasive But At Its Core Zimmer Brings A Solid Narrative,1431907200,

On disc one, the group starts their tale with the multi-tempo epic ""The King for a 1000 Years"". Clocking in a nearly fourteen minutes, this track takes you on a journey of driving riffs, fiery solos, melodic vocals, and pounding drums. Although not as lengthy, the same can be said for the bass heavy ""The Invisible Man"" and the guitar solo laden ""Born on Judgment Day"" ""Mrs. God"", despite its catchy chorus, comes off more as a pop-rock song than a power metal tune. Disc two is where things start to go downhill (see below), but still manages to pull out a few good songs. There are some monster riffs on ""Do You Know What You're Fighting For"" and some virtuoso solo work courtesy of Michael Weikath and Sascha Gerstner. ""Get It Up"" charges along muscle car barreling down the race track.

The Bad

There is no reason that both discs couldn't fit on one. What happened to their trademark frantic twin guitar attacks? There are a few here and there, but for the most part they're limited. The choruses can be catchy, but they're not as over-the-top as past Helloween songs. ""Occasion Avenue"" is another epic that starts off disc two. The intro in made up of someone tuning through radio stations that are player various songs from the original Keeper albums. I thought that was pretty lame. Let ""Light the Universe"" be a lesson to any power metal band that's thinking of a duet ballad...don't do it. Candice Night of Blackmore's Knight handles vocals. While the vocal performances by Candice and Andi are great, the presentation is not indicative of the genre or the band.

The Verdict

I've always enjoyed the Europeam metal scene. Just look at my older reviews for Helloween, Gamma Ray, and the like. That's why it pains me to write this. The biggest thing that irks me about Helloween as of late is their complete lack of consistency. Ever since they lost Kiske and Hansen they've tried everything they can to stay relevant; trying to sound darker, trying to sound like themselves, and now trying to recapture the grandeur that Keeper of the Seven Keys I & II brought them. Sorry guys, it was a totally different band and a totally different musical time period.

They're a few songs on The Legacy that capture the sound and magic that was Keeper of the Seven Keys, but for the most part the story is weak and the band switches from their power metal sound to sounding like a standard hard/rock metal band way too much for my tastes. Helloween try to recapture what made them great by revisiting the albums and themes that helped them break out, but somehow manage to stomp all over the legend that was The Keeper of the Seven Keys in the process. The album reeks of desperation, but manages to pack 50% worth of decent material.","The album reeks of desperation, but manages to pack 50% worth of decent material",1132012800,

Cooper appears on the back cover with slicked back short hair, long sleeved dress shirt and a tie.  A complete 360 from his para military character from his last incarnation on ""Special Forces"".

Highlights include ""Zorro's Ascent"" a song about Alice Cooper as Zorro.  How he thought up this one I'll never know, but it is funny and cleaver.  Three songs in the middle all run together ""Adaptable"", ""I Like Girls"", and ""Remarkably Insincere"".  They are all short punchy rock songs with funny lyrics.  ""Tag You're It"" sees Alice as a horror movie director.......or is he really a killer?  This is a great song and harkens back to his ""Welcome To My Nightmare"" days.  ""It Better Be Good"" is another short fun rocker. On the other side of the coin there is some pretty dreadful stuff on this album as well.  ""I Am The Future"" sounds like it is from the cheesy movie soundtrack where it originated.  ""No Baloney Homosapiens"" is, well just look at the title and you can pretty much guess.

THE DAY AFTER YESTERDAY is, unfortunately, a largely bland effort.  Springfield is still at the top of his form as a picker (there are some excellent guitar riffs in here), but his voice has gotten worse (worked well on SDAA, but a raspy, spoken-voiced version of ""Imagine""?  Come on).

Therefore, this record will undoubtably not win Springfield any new fans, nor please his old ones (especially since it's a cover album, and he has only one original on here that doesn't measure up to his usual songwriting standards).  The main flaw of the record is this: Springfield relies heavily on the drum machines he criticized in his hit ""Human Touch.""  In fact, this sounds more like a pop record than a rock record, with the saxaphones keeping it from going into Brittany Spears territory.  And while most of the songs he chose are of great quality, and while a few of his performances shine (""Life In A Northern Town"" and ""Miss You Nights"" specifically), THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is undeniably a let-down.  Maybe the album after this one will feature Springfield, if not in his finest vocal form, at least writing his own tunes again, and either making us swoon as in his 80s hits, or getting us pissed off as he did with SDAA.",One of our favorite rockers goes easy listening,1123113600,

For Keith Urban, he has had a lot of joy in his career with his success in country music. But overall, he has not had that widespread success cross over into the pop world, as was the case with Shania Twain or Faith Hill had delivered. Now, with a slew of good performances he has had, he now is trying to cross over with pop with his latest single, The Fighter from his album, Ripcord. the song, which features Carrie Underwood, works well for him as a solo track, but as a duet it misses the mark a bit. Carrie Underwood surprisingly underperforms on the song with having more of a voice into the pop anthem. While it sounds like a hit for Keith, and it is, there could've been a bit more chemistry into the track overall.

Fighting through being underrated compared to the likes of India. Arie, Erykah Badu, and even a youthful Alicia Keys, Stone always possessed the voice where her commercial endeavors fell short of where they should've been.  Stone, despite commercial shortcomings (and being in her 30s when her first solo album materialized in 1999's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Diamond/dp/B00001O2UV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Diamond</a>) managed two gold albums (Black Diamond and 2001's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahogany-Soul/dp/B00005PJFV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahogany Soul</a>), as well as some notable hits in R&B circles (""No More Rain In This Cloud,"" ""Brotha,"" ""U-Haul,"" and ""Baby"" amongst them). 2012's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rich-Girl/dp/B008D1RD5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rich Girl</a>&nbsp;plays very much like your typical Angie Stone album, only there is a bit of a downgrade with the 'swagger.' While Stone has always had anachronistic tendencies, she usually pulls off this 'old with the new' extremely confidently off-setting the 'vintage' nature.  This independent release comes off too safe, too conservative, and lacks the 'excitability' and 'vivaciousness' that other Stone albums present.

Overall the material is solid, though even the best cuts are safe. ""Do What U Gotta Do"" proceeds after a pointless intro, and is more notable in the context of this album than it was as somewhat of a bland, safe single.  It is not 'the second coming' by any means, but it stands out amongst such a safe set. Similarly, single ""Backup Plan"" showcases Stone's rich alto, but never 'captivates' the way the Gladys Knight sampling ""No More Rain In This Cloud"" or even Marvin Gaye cover ""Trouble Man"" did on her debut.  A gospel drawn out cut entitled ""Guilty"" is lovely, though a bit on the long side and by no means 'hip.'

""Rich Girl,"" the title track, is the album's best track.  Well produced, intact with Stone's signature supporting vocals, ""Rich Girl"" lacks flashiness, but suits Stone the best of any cut on the effort. ""Right in Front of Me"" is safe, but lays well with a vintage soul groove.  ""U Lit My Fire"" falls a bit short on the verses (Stone could assert more and bust a sweat perhaps), but delivers on a catchy chorus (""The first time that I met you baby... you lit my fire/you lit my fire..."").  ""Sisters"" closes somewhat 'schmalzy,' but the slow-paced anthemic cuts thematic material ('we are always sisters,' etc.) should strike some relatable chords with the audience.
The other tracks are solid with none bombing, but they don't stand out in particular. Even those that do save for maybe ""Rich Girl"" would have trouble superseding Stone's greatest hits.

Overall, if you are a hardcore Stone fan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rich-Girl/dp/B008D1RD5S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rich Girl</a>&nbsp;will appeal to you because Stone's voice sounds as polished as ever.  If you prefer 'old-school' R&B in the soul, retro-soul, neo-soul, or adult contemporary R&B vein, this album will suit you. If you are a more casual fan however, you may find this album safe, humdrum, and a bit underwhelming. From a critical standpoint, the judgement is this is a solid and soulful album, though not exciting. Furthermore, it does not deliver Stone's best material, even when her vocals soar.  3 Stars.",Solid and Soulful; Not Particularly Exciting,1348617600,

Esperanza Spalding's cover of Billie Holiday's ""I'll Look Around"" gets it exactly right.  Compared to Holiday's version, which was filled with languorous yearning, Spalding's is a little smoother and more upbeat, bringing an almost whimsical note to this song of lost love.  The background is easy-listening jazz - it's the sort of thing you might expect to hear playing softly in a classy restaurant.  Spalding's voice is just as appealing, silky and fluidly sensuous.

Because when the rabid Bill Donahue appeared on Fox News yesterday, he seemed to debut a new approach or tactic on his part in how to deal with gay people in general, and gay artists particularly. Donahue clearly was aiming to appear very relaxed and with-it. And though he was there to complain about some statement by the artist about Catholicism, and particularly because it came during Holy Week, his general strategy was clearly a new one.. His complaints are hardly news, since that is what he does. But the fact that he spent a large chunk of the interview opining about Lady Gaga's obvious talent surely is news. Apparently the tech people on the Fox News Channel are Lady Gaga fans, because Donahue emphasized that he had been talking of the singer's talent in the green room with them, so bubbling over with appreciation for cutting edge gay singer stylings that it takes over his small talk no less apparently. So, I am not sure what this milestone means, but it means something. Perhaps a clue might be found in the fact that he further explained that Catholics just want to be ""left alone"". Well given that the Roman Catholic Church is decidedly not into leaving others alone in society by their various campaign, one wonders at the man's logic. But the rather fawning praise for the singer's talent tells us, phenomenologically, that the Church apparently feels that they now must make some sort of use of the gay artiste vibe. That is the real news. They have glommed on to every other fad in past  in an effort to make their rigidity current and more palatable, and jettisoned their own glorious traditions,  and apparently  now we will soon be treated to parish minstrels in holy drag, with tech songs about the Virgin Mary or Jesus. I have a suggestion where they might start to find performers, and it is with a little Papist, as he calls himself, at the rabidly right-wing Catholic Vote Action.

And, just as with Williams' album, there are good reasons several reviewers seem to be 'working hard at trying to like it.'  Neither album has enough originality, energy or even catchy hooks to get played very often. (Plus, the Decemberists seem to rely on  'profound' &/or 'shock value' lyrics in all too many songs) The albums aren't bad; they are just not all that good.

It's sad, too, because both artists have produced excellent music in the past. In The Decemberists' case, ""The Crane Wife"" & ""The King Is Dead"" were very good, albeit with the yawner ""Hazards Of Love"" sandwiched between them.

If you find that you can't really get into ""What a Terrible..."" or ""Down Where..."" as much as you'd hoped, you might consider checking out Armistice or The Pierces (""Creation"", etc.).

They definitely took command when they had soared with Centuries. The song was definitely infectious, and their strongest anthem in their career as a band. The song definitely ranks high with great stadium anthems like Queen's We Will Rock You, and showed what they are still made of as a Y2K band still standing strong. Yet, I honestly do wish though that I could say the exact same thing about their second song from American Beauty / American Psycho. Uma Thurman, the second single from that album isn't actually as catchy or as strong as the first song. It is alright, but not really as a strong song that really is more driven than what Fall Out Boy had shown before. I do hope there is another single that can be better from the band down the road.

I learned a couple of things about this duo who scraped together different styles as they were developing their own harmonic sounds. This record is pretty much an acoustic fare with their voices and guitars and their original works like Sparrow and The Sound of Silence and He Was My Brother stand head and shoulders above their covering of others songs (yes, even above Bob Dylans The Times They Are A-Changin). The mix is like a stew that gives you different flavors and textures in each bite, and doesnt taste like it really goes together, but every so often you get a particular savory taste that hits some of the right notes and you realize that you're willing to try more.

But sadly, his music after his fame just hasn't been as strong as what he had before. Anyone trying to make a sense of the King Of Pop had before, is really not delivering in heart as well as in voice. A Place With No Name, which originally was planned to be released on the wasted Invincible album doesn't actually ignite a fire as much as what Michael had when he had sampled songs like You Rock My World. The take, on using America's standard song Horse With No Name feels like it lags at heart and rhythm. I really found the song to lack what The King Of Pop showed musically and vocally. He had much better songs like Black Or White and Dirty Diana. If you are really new to what Michael Jackson was in his heart, I absolutely suggest you pass this song up.

The musical support provided by Lowell George, other membrs of Little Feat and the Meters are simply stunning.  The keyboard parts stand out very much and the drumming is very funky.

Outside is another strong track.  Whereas I like Sailing Shoes, it just does not compare to the Little Feat version.  It all starts with the vocals.  Robert Palmer just can not compare to Lowell George on this track.

AS a matter of fact, Robert Palmers vocals are erratic on this CD.  He's very good on the title track, Outside and decent on a couple of others.  However, that last song, Throught It All With You, Mr. Palmer just sounds like he is grunting and does not rise above the solid backing unit.

When I think about Isley's vocal gift, I cannot find a modern vocalist who comes close to emulating his sensually driven brand of soul.  At 72 years old, it is a musical blessing that Ronald Isley is still able to successfully record albums, which makes his 2013 solo effort&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Song-Is-for-You/dp/B00BEWNAA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Song Is for You</a>&nbsp;so special.  The problem with the album is, that it just doesn't quite stack up with the classics of The Isley Bros. or even the Isley Bros.' most recent material which featured Ron in solo capacity anyways (at least for the most part).  It has its moments, but This Song Is For You's shortcomings most often come courtesy of some blas&eacute; material.

""This Song Is For You"" and first single ""Dinner And A Movie"" both show Isley at his best.  Vocally, his pipes shine commandingly here, riding the adult contemporary R&B production like a 'boss'.  Kem enters the picture for a duet on ""My Favorite Thing"" which is solid, but could use a little extra 'spice' from the tried-and-true.  As solid as Kem sounds, Ronald Isley captivates even more, delivering the more present vocal performance.

""The Boss"" finds Isley flexing his vocals expectedly, even if the song is a 'B' cut at best.  ""Bed Time"" follows up sensually right up Mr. Biggs' alley, but comes off unmemorable ultimately.  It doesn't help that that tempo is a grinder, which makes an average cut drag on even longer.  ""Another Night"" has great inspiration behind it by sampling the Isley Bros's '80s classic ""Between The Sheets"".  The problem is, you find yourself wishing ""Another Night"" WAS indeed the classic and not a less notable newbie.  By the time the Trey Songz featuring ""Lay You Down"" arrives, it is welcome because the effort was losing some momentum. The duet that brings veteran and burgeoning R&B artist is by no means the year's most triumphant get together, but it is one of the highlights from This Song is For You.

""Reunion"" can't quite match the bar raised by ""Lay You Down"", but Mr. Biggs does pretty good for himself ultimately.  He's better rounded on ""He Won't Ever Love You"" in which a many times tread concept retains its freshness given Isley's timeless voice and musicianship.  After that, it's pretty forgettable.  ""Better or Worse"" is so-so burdened down by continual relaxed tempi. ""Let's Be Alone"" begins promising with Bryan Michael Cox and Kendrick Dean running the show production-wise, but this infusion of promise only lasts briefly as the cut still drags a bit given tempo and overall sameness.  ""Make Love To Your Soul"" also fails to incite many thrills.

Ultimately,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/This-Song-Is-for-You/dp/B00BEWNAA0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">This Song Is for You</a>&nbsp;is not a 'thrill seeker's' album by any means. It does its job well of showing off the skill that Ronald Isley has shared with us vocally for years and years and years.  That said, it doesn't say truly 'accentuate' his/his brothers' legacy the way that it could have with more thoughtful, creative material.

The voice is pleasant and communicative and honest and that is refreshing.  The few songs that are offered here do not a full album make, but Boyle does give a lovely rendition of the light popular voice offering Christmas wishes. She is not to be compared with classical singers because that is simply not her category.

His latest song, She Came To Give It To You, which features Nicki Minaj doesn't have the stride as his earlier songs. It also sounds a bit similar to Robin Thicke's Blurred Lines, by sampling the Marvin Gaye song, Got To Give It Up. Sadly, it loses a bit of the stride.

The feeling of the song is trying to re-ignite more of a darker tone into a ballad, but yet at times the song doesn't bring out what Jamie had been known for with music.

It is most definitely her beautiful voice and flair for some whimsical and fun lyrics that save this album that is musically not in her tone nor fit her style very well.  I appreciate Jewel trying something new and I also am glad she got it out of her system and didn't find the need to go back to this as this style of music and production doesn't fit her folksy shape and leanings.  A big part of her draw is her earthy, grounded guitar and other natural instrumental sounds; you won't find much of that here.  This synth-pop-techno music strips away some of her soul.  Still, even if the style is beneath her her voice still is as lovely as ever, even beneath and through so much digitization.

1) Stand: it's okay.  Starting us off with Jewel's voice front and center as uninspired, syncopated beats and some buzzes chirp here and there.  ""Reach"" would have been an appropriate title as she is reaching for something different here and this song sets the tone for the album pretty well.
2) Run 2 U: her lovely,soft voice saves a song without musical importance.
3) Intuition: Singing twice and three times over her own voice and some fun namedropping in the lyrics with a buzzy chorus lifts this otherwise forgettable piece.
4) Leave the Lights On: Now here's something that starts off a little more interesting with some brassy woodwinds and a bluesy style.  Unfortunately when Jewel gets to the chorus the song loses steam but this is the most interesting song of the CD so far.
5) 2 Find U: Weak.
6) Fragile Heart: A bit slow with a country guitar twang slowly plucked.  Too slow, though.
7) Doin' Fine: ""We are what everyone wants to be.""  We are doin' fine.  Buried in the middle of the record the song is rather okay.
8) 2 Become 1: The music is much more engaging and natural.  This feels like a Jewel song and could be on any one of her albums (minus the way she is ""spells"" the song title...).
9) Haunted: A seductive and creepy song.  Totally cool and different.  Uh, and kinda sensuous.  Jewel's moaning at the end of the song is...well, let's just say that I'm glad that it doesn't go on too long.
10) Sweet Temptation: Sounding much more like a Shakira pop song this one actually pretty much works and is much better than any of the first three songs.
11) Yes U Can: This one might just make you dance.  Again, a love and sex song that is both a joinder and a cautious observation.  It is minorly infectious.
12) U & Me = Love: Dance pop bubblegum fluff.  Blech.
13) America: Overly easy political thoughts are dispensed.  It's okay, unless you're tired of hearing popsters and others bagging on America.  Not nearly one of her best social observation songs (probably because it's so politicized).
14) Becoming: Lyrically well-suited to the empty dance-pop genre, Jewel witnesses her own ""becoming"" with her heart.  Ahhh, isn't that nice.  Maudlin stuff.

As you might have guessed this isn't my favorite Jewel album.  But there is at least one gem on here and a few other songs that work.  If you're interested in what Jewel has to offer I'd highly suggest starting elsewhere (personally, I'd direct you to ""This Way"") and if you like your techno-dance-pop I'd look somewhere else too.",Shaking her Shakira?

The past few years showed Rihanna doing more singles that really were not a part of what became Anti, and bigger hits than what she released from Anti, with the exception of Work. Her latest single, Love On The Brain, the fourth from Anti, shows Rihanna is trying to be more of a swooner in the way other legendary divas had shown in classic R&B like the legendary Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin showcased. But Rihanna does not make the mark well, and sadly it is not the best on what she had n ballads for her songs. She showed it better when she teamed up with Ne-Yo on Hate That I Love You a decade ago.

It is rich and very strong, even on uptempo tracks. There are not many female R&B vocalists of her era who can hold a candle to her voice. Compare her voice to someone like Jennifer Hudson. Of course, Jennifer's voice is overall stronger, but I said that in order to paint a picture for it to be understood just how strong her voice is.

""Love Me Back"" is a good album. I graded it 3.5 out of 5. The only song that sticks out in my mind after listening, though, is ""Good Enough."" I heard this song one time and fell in love with it. That song? Now that is what I call music! The production is wonderful (Prince's ""Beautiful Ones"" is sampled), her vocals are great and the lyrics are quite profound. The message is if a man will not love you right, another man will be happy to. It's a beautiful, quality track and the standout moment of the 11 tracks. Missy Elliot can be found hollering randomly on the album. I really wish she and Jermaine Dupri would stop doing that. Enough is enough. ""Don't Make Me Wait"" has a great uptempo beat. It's another track inspired by the one and only Prince.

Nothing groundbreaking or especially innovative here beside her creative lyrics. I can say I really enjoy listening to the words in her songs because her lyrics have something a lot of music of today lacks and that is content. It's a cool listen.

'I Dreamed a Dream' was a pleasant album to listen to, though by no means revolutionary, yet most people were not bothered by this given that the album's muse was in here late forties.  On&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gift/dp/B003GAMPWM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gift</a>, Boyle similarly doesn't ruffle any feathers, but go `round, people take notice of the `lack of flair' about 'The Gift.'  Sure, Boyle sounds beautiful, but even at times this is compromised if for no other reason than the overly safeness of the performances and the blandness of the material from this album.  Even more confusing may be the fact that 'The Gift' tries to `have cake and eat it too' by poising itself as `holiday' effort that also includes a couple of neutral pop numbers.  The results are not quite a flop (and it won't fill like a flop to Boyle's more committed fan base), but an album that produces only mixed results as opposed to being valedictory.

Boyle starts the album on a high note with her cover of the Lou Reed cut ""Perfect Day.""  Interesting about ""Perfect Day"" is the fact that Boyle recorded an accompanying music video for the track - her first.  The production is typical of the airy, moody and atmospheric production that characterized the majority of cuts from 'I Dreamed a Dream.'  Here use of strings and piano serve as a nice, if simple backdrop for Boyle.  Vocally beautiful,  Boyle's vocals are restrained and plaintive, though by no means revolutionary or extraordinary. Nonetheless, ""Perfect Day"" is arguably the best track on The Gift.  Leonard Cohen's ""Hallelujah"" attempts the same grandeur with chilly piano, strings, and ambiance-driven background vocals, but does not achieve the same `high watermark.'  ""Hallelujah"" proves to be so slow that it comes over as lethargic;  the lethargy actually takes away from the appeal of this ubiquitous classic.  The production is so dense and lacking in clarity that it feels `mushed' together as opposed to having a sense of organization.

""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" resounds the atmospheric production that characterizes Boyle's sound, which makes the listener wonder `why does every production have to sound the same?'  Nonetheless, pure vocals by Boyle smothered in reverb prove to captivate enough that ""Do You Hear What I Hear?"" atones for the overly slow treatment of ""Hallelujah."" That said, the predictability of this track is even more pronounced than usual for a Christmas track, perhaps due in part to the predictability that surrounds this traditional singer.  ""Don't Dream It's Over"" is a nice enough pop turn from Boyle, but again,  the track sounds sleepy despite a solid vocal from Boyle.  Again, this is a `pop' song interspersed between Christmas cuts, which is an odd premise in the first place.  That said, follow-up cut ""The First Noel"" is perfect (as perfect as any cut can be on this affair) with a nice change of pace including accompaniment initially by acoustic guitar and a natural feeling evolution within this cut.  ""The First Noel"" puts `some pep in the step' of the album giving it a bit more life and showing off Susan Boyle, the star that all feel in love with.

""O Holy Night"" isn't bad, though the production recalls ""Amazing Grace's"" treatment from her prior effort.  Boyle attempts to achieve magic at the end on the tried-and-true climax ""O Night Divine,"" but false vocals from the singer slightly dilutes the emotion.  Again, dense production makes ""O Holy Night"" feel a bit all-over-the-place.  ""Away in a Manger"" is predictable, opening with a choir covering the first verse and Boyle handling duties on the second verse supported by strings.  Again, `the formula' grows old here; a brief length serves as a highlight of this cut.

""Make Me a Channel of Your Piece"" is lovely, but ultimately a bore serving more as `background music' than a vital piece of The Gift.  ""Auld Lang Syne"" is pleasant while closing cut ""O Come All Ye Faithful"" feels appropriately placed and closes the album solidly, but again by no means exceptionally.

Overall, 'The Gift' feels lukewarm and underwhelming.  Boyle sounds strong enough, but the strength that propelled her on British Got Talent feels absent here - or at least compromised by the murky production and predictable, unexceptional material on the album. That is hard to say sense carols and covers themselves are rather predictable, but maybe just a slight change of pace or alterations of these classics might have taken the tone and the enjoyability of 'The Gift' to the next level.","Enjoyable Moments, But Some Changes Need to Made For Next Album",1289520000,

""This Masquerade"" was a light jazz easy listening hit and ""Breezin"" was a hit too. ""This Masquerade"" had the unique distinction of hitting number one on the jazz, R&B, and pop charts; I wonder if any other tune has performed that trifecta. Jazz players will be very familiar with this tune and having the original version for library was the main reason I picked up a bargain version of the album. I did not realize, however, that the new remastered version has extra versions of some of the tracks as well as a version of ""Down Here On the Ground"" a very Donny Hathawayesque tune that I dig off of the ""Weekend In LA"" album.
""Breezin"" sounds like easy listening light jazz but it's a pleasing chart that I enjoy with its flute hook but it's got a nice groove to it as well and . This stuff drips with 70s production values and has a Bob James kind of sound. If you like that kind of light jazz than ""Breezin"" is an excellent album. I find it to be pleasing light jazz that doesn't wear as well as his ""Weekend In LA"" album, where the live performance brings out more fire for George Benson. This album was one of the blueprints for smooth jazz and folks that dig smooth jazz would be wise to look at Benson, with his soulful jazz chops and breathtaking Hathaway like voice before they dig into the latest thing playing on light jazz radio.

Opening Brandon Flowers' debut CD is the theatrical ballad ""Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas"" (""Did nobody tell you, the house will always win""), not too far in sound from the day job. In fact, the album is produced by Stuart Price who also produced The Killers' last ""Day and age"". Not a bad thing if you, like me, are a fan of The Killers. However, the album is a patchy listening experience. It's filled with ballads, a good number of which are desperately ordinary, not doing justice to Flowers' exuberant voice, (""Only the young"" for example) and filled with copious mention of angels and demons, salvation, and other vivid biblical imagery.

Still it has its moments; the Countrified ""Hard enough"" is a duet with Jenny Lewis and sounds like Bruce Springsteen, as does the bouncy ""Jilted lovers and broken hearts"". The Country feel is felt also in ""Was it something I said?"" and ""The clock was tickin'"" with spoken Jack White-channeling verses.

""Crossfire"" is a nice ballad Coldplay or Keane-style, while the hymnal ""On the floor"" is a spare ballad. The midtempo chugging ""Right behind you"" has lovely reverbing guitars. Standout has got to be the Americana ""Playing with fire"" with a bruised Flowers sounding strangled in the wail-like chorus to stunning effect.

Famous words sang in a famous song, sung by a famous drummer. No Ringo, wed never walk out on you. Never. Not even if theres a fire. But the same can no longer be said of the Flaming Lips and their extremely old and stale shenanigans. I think Im honestly one of the remaining few that have held on up to this point. I championed The Terror, that Peace Sword S/T, and that 7 Skies H3 album they released last RSD(I honestly thing 7 Skies H3 is some of the best stuff theyve done since Embryonic.) Man, Ive taken every bitter pill theyve sent my way and Ive loved every weird trip theyve taken me on. But this cover album of Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band? Nah, I just cant do it anymore. Im through. There needs to be some sort of intervention for Mr. Coyne. Shut down his Instagram. Take away his gummy molding machine, and all of his plastic doo dads he covers himself in on stage. He needs to seriously get his head out of whatever fumes hes been inhaling and breathe in some untainted oxygen. The jig is up, you fearless freak.

Let me first say that Im not some Beatles extremist. When I first heard the Lips were covering Sgt Pepper I was thrilled. I was and still am a huge fan of their take on The Dark Side of the Moon. I felt that in their own way The Flaming Lips stayed true to that album without compromising any of their weirdness. If they were to do that with Sgt Pepper, then we were going to be in for a real treat. I mean, Sgt Pepper was a massive statement. A milestone, and an album that in many eyes can never be replicated or matched. The Lips created that for me in 1999 when they put out The Soft Bulletin. That album was pure, child-like honesty put to otherworldly and ethereal music. It encapsulated the wonder and fear of life and death, all brought together by Wayne Coynes wavering and breaking voice. I was 24 years old when that album came out and it affected me much like Sgt Pepper affected so many folks 32 years before. How could Wayne Coyne and company screw this up? I don't know, but they did.

This album really comes off as a big, noisy mess. Its as if Coyne and company weren't even there. They let special guests(and there were quite a few) in the studio, locked them in, and proceeded to pump in nitrous oxide through the vents to see what would happen. Its a real shame, too, as underneath it all theres some great performances by The Autumn Defense, Dr. Dog, Phantogram, and My Morning Jacket. Those performances are covered in clumps of audio fuzz, grime, and over blown excess. Yes, Im aware Im talking about the Flaming Lips when Im complaining about excess. Heres the thing: the Lips have always excelled at excess. They do excess beautifully. But here the excess is excessive. A beautiful vocal performance by the Autumn Defense in With A Little Help From My Friends is completely stunted by pairing them with Black Pus. Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band is shat upon by a overzealous guitar solo by the wonderful J Mascis at the end. Getting Better, featuring Dr. Dog, seems like a completely incredible combination until you throw Chuck Inglish in there as well and it just kinda falls flat on its face. I wouldve loved to have heard Dr. Dogs full access on this track, with the Lips noodling on the knobs and faders a bit. Instead we get this detached Chuck Inglish vocal over top Dr. Dog with some pretty great stereo drums. Its so close to perfection. A Day In The Life, while not bad, seems to just fall a little flat. This shouldve been monstrous, explosive, and beautiful. Instead, we get the most restraint weve seen on this covers album where it shouldve been the biggest statement possible.

A lot of people have bitched and moaned about Miley Cyrus connection to the Lips and Coyne, and especially her inclusion on this album. Well Im here to say she is not to blame for the issues here. She does fine, really. She is featured on A Day In The Life, as well as one of the album highlights, Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds. They go big for Lucy and it works beautifully. Electric Wurms cover of Fixing A Hole is also a nice surprise. They pretty much stick to script here, with some nice, dreamy effects. Sorta like Yes covering the Beatles and it works. Shes Leaving Home is quite melancholy with Phantogram, Julianna Barwick, and Spaceface. It has an 80s electro vibe with all of the original tracks mournful feel. Being For The Benefit of Mr. Kite! with Maynard James Keenan is a perfect fit, actually. It has a carnival of souls aura and Keenan makes the track his own. Within You Without You with Birdflower and Morgan Delt keeps the mystical vibe of Harrisons original, with some modern touches that aren't too overbearing. Most of the rest? Kinda just there, really.

The strangest thing is that you wouldnt even know this was a project curated by The Flaming Lips if it weren't for the production. You hear them in like two tracks. Other than that, who knows? Even with something like Heady Fwends you got the feeling Wayne, Steve, and Michael were in the room with their fwends. Not so much here.

I look at classic albums like Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, Pet Sounds, and Odyssey and Oracle and I compare them to classical pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Debussy. They fall under the canon of timeless pieces of music and should be interpreted and endeared by future musicians and artists. Weve done this for hundreds of years and it is a practice that should continue for hundreds of years to come. The Flaming Lips, I felt, were a band to do such a thing with The Beatles. They did right by Pink Floyd. Theyll do right by The Beatles, right? Even for Coyne, Drozd, and Ivins this is pretty far out there. Theyve taken themselves and a bunch of great artists and covered their covers of Lennon/McCartney compositions in so much noise its hard to discern anyones original intent.

This certainly isn't a phoned-in tribute. Its ambitious, ballsy, and grand for sure. But even Pollack knew when enough was enough. Wayne, sometimes less is more. I still love you, but Im gonna have to walk away on this one.",A Big Mess,1414454400,

The South Floridian act have weathered many hard-ships that have sunk lesser bands. Through label shake-ups and band member break-ups, Nonpoint have kept plowing straight ahead, for better and sometimes for worse. When they emerged in 2012 with a new line-up and a self-titled album, they sounded refreshed and revitalized and ready to conquer the world. Unfortunately, on its follow-up, ""The Return,"" Nonpoint set their controls to ""cruise.""

It's not that ""The Return"" is bad or offensive in any manner. It's nowhere near the clunker that was 2010's muddled ""Miracle"" or 2007's numbing ""Vengeance,"" but it's not really anything special, either. On the surface, everything sounds fine. The band (still the same line-up that played on the self-titled) are still in top form, chugging along at just the right pace. What's really missing from the mix though is the ear-candy that has come to define the band. You know what I'm talking about; ""What A Day,"" ""Bullet With A Name,"" ""Left For You,"" etc. In the past you could always rely on this band to churn out at least a few hook-heavy tunes per album. Sadly, ""The Return"" offers nothing of the sort.

Lord knows the band tries to keep things fresh. ""Widowmaker"" takes on an old-school Metallica aesthetic that is surprisingly competent and tastefully done, but is unfortunately countered by the mis-guided, bro-rock anthem of sorts, ""F**K'D."" Like their tendency to follow up greatness (""To The Pain"") with mediocrity (the aforementioned ""Vengeance"" and ""Miracle""), it's a one-step forward/two-steps back scenario with this album. For every fun, heavy, catchy and/or thrilling moment, Nonpoint lift its collective leg to drop a dud or two. The dual-guitarist approach serves the likes of ""Know Myself"" and ""Breaking Skin,"" but sadly, frontman Elias Soriano isn't on his A-game. Most of the album works as passable background music if you don't listen too closely, but sadly a deeper listen reveals a well-produced and well-played album that lacks significant hooks or memorable melodies.

In typical Nonpoint fashion, they parted ways with guitarist Dave Lizzio and replaced him with B.C. Kochmit (Eye Empire) soon after recording of the album was complete. Hopefully another change in line-up will give the band another wind and they'll come back swinging with another album that hits hard.

Of the 3, Raw Footage was definitely my favorite. It might even be in my top 5 Cube records. The lyrics were so on point, between it and Laugh Now Cry Later, it really seemed like hed found that spark he had when writing stories back between 90-93.

The music and beaten on I Am The West is probably my favorite since Lethal Injection because it was modern AND extremely unique, not just piggybacking off whatever sound is popular the minut he was writing the song... because if you write a song to be popular right then, chances are, in 6 months when its released, its gonna sound played out, let alone a year or two from now when you're looking for something to listen to... bottom line, musically, this is top 5 of his to me.

But now the problem... the reason this album only gets 3 stars is because this is the FIRST album hes put out in his (at the time) 24 year career containing ALL but one song (Hood Robbin) is essentially just emceeing the whole time... in other words, just bragging about himself and his skills/rep. Gone are the stories and descriptions of life in that way that only he does.

The whole reason Cube has stood above the rest is because hes always balanced the emceeing with the storytelling (with a strong majority on each album leaning towards the latter) because Cube was supposed to be ABOVE that petty garbage and all the rappers that based their entire careers off doing just that.

BOTTOM LINE, any Cube album is a great rap album because no one does it like him. The music is great, his lyrics are still great, its just the subject matter is weak, and unfortunately, subject matter makes up about 51% of the reason that an album great, and about 80% of the reason an album is worth listening to more than once.","In a perfect world, Id rate it 3.5, but since I cant... sorry Cube...

This one is one of the exceptions. One of the reasons that I like this album so much is because of its overall ""laid-back"" feel. I like that it isn't wild or very rocking. Listening to it has a very soothing effect for me (usually, anyway). Burl, with his warm, friendly voice, doesn't come across as a ""celebrity"" but as more of a ""grandfatherly"" figure. The instrumentation on the album is very lovely as are the choral back-up vocals. Of course, the title track and ""Rudolph"" are probably the most-known tracks on the album, but the others are good, too. The album has one of the best versions of ""Little Drummer Boy"" that I've heard! ""I Heard The Bells On Christmas Day"" closes the album perfectly. Right now, it would be hard for me to name my favorite song(s) from the album, but put a gun to my head and make me pick my one favorite song, and it would probably be ""Christmas Can't Be Far Away."" The only thing I really dislike about this album is how short it is (under 30 minutes). It would have been nice if it had included some bonus stuff, or had been paired with Burl Ives' Christmas Album (which contains completely different material). But still, this is a wonderful album!",wonderful album!,1354492800,

Opening are a trio of highlights; the horn-peppered funky ditty by Cee Lo Green with vocals channeling Al Green singing the lines ""When the morning comes and I'm not there, Darlin', please understand that I'm a man!', ""Yes I Do"" by Carmen Ejogo, a bouncy Motown-style number, and Goapele's ""Running"" which is set thumping beats with hues of Martha Reeves and the Vandellas. A winning opening salvo.

Next come songs which featured in the 1976 movie; the ballad ""Hooked On Your Love"" features Carmen Ejogo, Tika Sumpter, and Jordin Sparks and is velvet smooth soul. They also perform the upbeat clap-sprinkled ""Jump"" and the sensual ""Something He Can Feel"" (the latter which can't hold a candle to the Aretha or En Vogue versions but is still smooth and nice in its restrained way).  Whitney performs ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow"" (not in the 1976 movie) to cascading piano/organ accompaniment initially, with a choir coming in towards the end - understated yet regal. ""Look Into Your Heart"" is a piano ballad by Sparks, who also sings the R. Kelly-penned Gospel-style ""One Wish"" (featuring Sparks' most theatrical vocals) and ""Love Will"", the latter with a spoken intro. Closing is the upbeat ""Celebrate, also penned by Mr Kelly, with stomping beats and a neo disco sound.

Blige hasn't been afraid to step out of her comfort zone. After the release of 1994's ""My Life"", she went on a musical journey that showed her maturing and evolving. Her first album without the auspices of mentor Sean ""Puffy"" Combs - 1997's ""Share My World"" saw Blige break through with newcomer Rodney Jerkins while working with R&B legends Jimmy Jam  & Terry Lewis, George Benson and James Mtume. 1999's ""Mary"" was largely devoid of any hip hop influences, but ironically became one of her best albums. 2001 saw the release of the aptly titled ""No More Drama"", where Blige wanted to leave behind the music of her past and transition to a happier vibe - much to the chagrin of her fans. She reunited with Combs on the noticeably upbeat ""Love & Life"", while adopting a more mature outlook for 2005's ""The Breakthrough"" and 2007's ""Growing Pains"". After two more recordings for Interscope, Blige decided she wanted a change of labels - as well as a change of scenery. Those changes brought about her 2014 album ""The London Sessions"".

Her first album for historic label Capitol Records, Blige decided to collaborate with mostly British producers, songwriters and singers - most of whom were big fans of hers. The only American musician involved in the project is Blige's longtime collaborator Rodney Jerkins. On the album, she works with British producers such as Disclosure, Sam Romans, Fraser T. Smith, Jimmy Napes and Steve Fitzmaurice. Blige also gets songwriting help from UK singers - and Capitol labelmates - Sam Smith and Emeli Sande. Blige starts off the recording with the track ""Therapy"", where she tries to deal with her difficult emotions. On the track ""Doubt"", Blige tries to remain positive in the face of negative criticism and tries to help a significant other's self esteem on ""Not Loving You"". She expresses her feelings on the lovelorn ballad ""When You're Gone"", which leads into the first single, the trip hop influenced first single ""Right Now"". She sings of dealing with relationship up and downs on ""Long Hard Look"", while exploring the topic of heartbreak and domestic violence on the single ""Whole Damn Year"". She collaborates with Disclosure again on the track ""Follow"" and ends the album with ""Worth My Time"". ""The London Sessions"" is a good recording from Mary J. Blige. Although it's deeply rooted in the the subject of heartbreak, she makes an effort to expand her sound beyond her usual hip hop soul fare. To that end, she's made a listenable effort without alienating her fanbase.","Mary J. Blige takes her sound overseas for ""The London Sessions"".",1454025600,

Because it seems like for much of the album he just bangs away at his piano. The songs sound quite alike and at times he seems too sorry for himself, this isn't saying the album is bad. Hopefully on his next album he will learn from some of the mistakes he made on this album. Some parts of the album are perfect, it's just not all of it is. Some of the lyrics seem a bit out of proportion for this album and don't seem to fit. Like the lyrics on ""Belief"" are a bit sexually driven and are quite stupid and lame. The whole album doesn't have a very sexually driven attitude at all, anyway that song is the only one that appears a bit out of the ordinary. ""Chariot"" has a very mature and overall wholesome feel to it. DeGraw seems to have real talent, writing all the songs himself in all, yet the comparisons I can make to Destiny's Child is unforgivable.

Every album he has put out has been at least good, and excellent at his best. And that continues with Makings of A Man. I think Ja made a good choice in switching record labels and going to Atlantic, because at Warner he wasn't getting any promotion. This was the first time i had to go to 2 different stores to find the damn album, because they were sold out at the first store. Jaheim is a breath of fresh air in the state of R&B right now. Because most of the R&B being put out right now revolves around Sex, partying, and drugs. And some of that is ok in small doses but to make a whole album around that gets old real fast. But Ja knows how to balance his albums between Love & Sex. He doesnt over do it on this album, along with any of his other albums. But the biggest thing that i think helped him in the move to Atlantic, was that it introduced him to some new and better producers. This is the first time a Ja album has actually had a more contempary feel to it. Like the stellar Babyface written ""Just Don't Get It"", this is totally different than the Ja we are used to. This song totally sounds like it could be on the radio. Excellent track. Like on the R. Kelly produced ""Hush"" where Ja reminices about how he had an affair with his best friends girl. This album is alot different sounding than his previous albums, but its a good thing. While ""Never"" could possibly be played at weddings, he can still do songs that the thugs can feel to like ""Life of a Thug"". And the other thing that i really like about this album (This might sound weird), is that he released it in December. Which in my opinion is the perfect time for him to release an album because in winter, i always find myself listening to his albums. I don't know what it is but during the winter his music just does it for me when i am driving around. Not that during the summer or whatever i don't like him, but during the winter i always make sure to have at least one of his albums in the car with me at all times. I think it could be his just smooth but jagged vocals that just warms the air during the winter that makes his music so attractive during the winter season. And we all know Ja can blow, unless you are new to Ja, now is the perfect time to introduce yourself. And this album will be in heavy rotation for quite some time because it is just as good as his previous albums, if not better. Another hit for Jaheim... as usual!

Stutheit,"Despite having a completely new line-up than the one that recorded the first part of the ""Keeper Of The Seven Keys"" series eighteen years ago, ""Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy"" marks something of a return to form for German power metal primitives/pioneers Helloween. Bursting at the seems with all of the good stuff that is regularly found in PM -- i.e. strong hooks, crunchy guitar licks, wailing solos, Bruce Dickinson-inspired singing, etc. -- this 2005 effort breaks absolutely no new ground for the band or genre. But it is still a really darn good and impossible to dislike one, nonetheless.

So now that we have established how excellent ""The Legacy"" is, it should also be noted how epic it is. It is a sprawling, seventy-seven minute-long affair spread out over the course of thirteen tracks and two discs. And while Helloween's Iron Maiden and Judas Priest influences might be as strong as ever, here, the band still manages to somehow possess their own unique sound. It is much more ambitious and progressive than anything that either of those two bands had successfully attempted to date (prior to the year 2005).

After a lengthy, drawn-out, and really ominous intro, opener ""The King For A Thousand Years"" kicks up a thrashy groove with speedy double bass thudding, soaring melodic vocals, crunchy speed metal riffing, and galloping beats. From there, things do proceed to get a little mellow, as the song adopts a nice, twin-guitar harmony section, flashy soloing, and pretty acoustic bridge; but this fourteen minute-long epic finally picks back up again to galloping speed metal territory (iced with Maiden-inspired singing and aggressive tempo'ing). The next track, ""The Invisible Man,"" begins with an excellent, and highly technical slapped bass solo that flows into highly energetic and crunchy proto-thrash riffing, twiddly guitar soloing, and steady, humming bass lines. The guitar solo work is very lengthy, sustained, epic, and air-guitar-able in this song, but it also features some memorably falsetto vocal hooks, and prog-ish synth soloing.

Next comes ""Born On Judgment Day,"" which kicks off with another tricky bass intro before settling into a propulsive, Motorhead-esque double-bass-aided speed metal groove. This highly technical and complex mini-epic finds everybody getting in on the action, as it also boasts a nimble, skillful mid-song drum solo, followed by a bass solo, and more delicious, shred-happy guitar solo work. ""Pleasure Drone,"" then, is another equally-as-large standout, as it is a bass-heavy song with prominent, muscularly grumbling bass lines flowing throughout. It, however, is also highlighted by solid guitar leads, and great, epically high-flying solo flights. The remaining two songs on the first disc are two other considerably large standouts, as ""Mrs. God"" boasts huge, infectiously catchy choruses, and technical, mid-song bass soloing, while ""Silent Rain"" is a piece of pure, straight-up Eighties thrash metal, through and through. It is backed by ripping, wah-tinged soloing, forceful double bass heft, and crunching, rigid, chainsaw-fast guitar picking

The second disc is a little inconsistent, but certainly not without some charm. It opens with the very catchy and groove-happy ""Occasion Avenue."" This song can claim to have substantial merit, as it does feature choral-esque chanting vocals, propulsive thrash beats, grumbling bass lines, crunching guitar licks, and soaring guitar harmonies -- and although plenty of soulful, falsetto vocal hooks find their way into the mix, here, too -- but on the whole, it is just a so-so song. Clocking in at over eleven minutes in length, it does get a little boring and unnecessarily repetitive. And ""Light The Universe"" is also the source of some drag, as it is a slow, and even kind of plodding, piano-aided power ballad. (Although it does score a few merit points for featuring guest female vocals from Blackmore Night's Candice Night.)

Fear not, though, because the memorably muscular ""Do You Know What You're Fighting 4?"" kicks the energy level up way high again, as it is a chunky number with clearly Megadeth-ian riffing, and rhythmic, galloping beats. Also included here are an excellent, dazzling, wailing, trade-off solo section, and an empowering, and nearly anthemic chorus. And ""Come Alive"" is another very thrashy piece, although it is preceded by the seriously-proggy ""Shade In The Shadow,"" a song that, with its infectiously melodic and falsetto vocal hooks, and good, prog-ish soloing, ends up sounding not unlike some Dream Theater tunes. Back on the downside again, ""Get It Up"" is, unfortunately, a mostly unremarkable inclusion. But, it, again, is followed-up by another beaming moment of potential, this one coming in the form of ""My Life For One More Day,"" which is a very propulsive album closer with tasty, crunchy riffing and immediately catchy and memorable sing/chant-along vocals out the yin-yang.

The bottom line is that if you have not already been charmed or coerce into liking Helloween (and if you haven't, what the heck is the matter with you?!), ""Keeper Of The Seven Keys: The Legacy"" is not likely to change your mind. But longtime Helloween fans should feel anything but let down with this latest installment. So make sure there is plenty of room left in your C.D. collection/shelf to add this epically epic prog/power metal opus to it.","A surprisingly epic, if unsurprisingly excellent Helloween effort",1397606400,

""From the Mars Hotel"", while nowhere nearing deserving of the title great or inspired, is nonetheless a solid and listenable affair.
  The strength of the material paves way for a lot of this album's success.  Songs that would soon become live standards- ""Scarlet Begonias"", ""U.S. Blues"", ""Ship of Fools""- mixed with instant classics that we wished we heard more of live- ""China Doll"", ""Unbroken Chain"", ""Loose Lucy""- mixed with two of the strangest songs the Dead ever recorded- ""Pride of Cucamonga"", ""Money Money""- and the whole becomes this enjoyable, never boring little ride.  Phil Lesh is represented twice, with his ""Unbroken Chain"" pushing the Dead's musical boundaries and forcing them to step up their game, with success.  Jerry dominates the album, providing a timeless ballad in ""China Doll"", some loose funk with ""Loose Lucy"", and a calypso classic in ""Scarlet Begonias"".  Bob is the only one who strikes out, with the horrible but hilariously so, ""Money Money"".
  As with all the recent re-releases, this album also comes with a handful of live and studio outtakes from the same era, and while not as inspired or valuable as other albums' bonus tracks, there are some nice treats here. Live versions of ""Scarlet Begonias"" and ""Let It Rock"" are the obvious highlights, along with live curios ""Money Money"" and ""Wave That Flag"", which is essentially an early version of this album's ""U.S. Blues"".  The remaining three bonus tracks are studio outtakes, providing an interesting look into how the Dead build upon and re-imagine basic tracks.
  The production is clean without being too slick, and at times, the band sounds similar to its stealthier live incarnation.  Again, in no way a great album, but by Dead standards, one of the better studio efforts.",Decent studio work by the Dead,1291507200,

The fans loved them, the critics hated them and just 'didn't GET it, man.'  Sex, drugs, car accidents and rumors of underage girls and black magic, too. The endless tours and life on the road was slowly taking it's toll on the band. So, Page and Plant handed over the reins to John Paul Jones and the result was ""In Through The Out Door"". Soaked in keyboards and vodka, this was to be their final studio album with the legendary John Bonham. It sounds like none of their previous efforts and stands alone as a true classic. 'In the Evening' is majestic in it's sound. So many great tracks from this album! Its often overlooked but time has pressed it into a milestone for the band.

I found other tracks on the cd to be as noteworthy if not more.  The first single, ""Spotlight"" for one which she sings of her man loving her a bit too much.  Always possessive and smothering, it's a nice debut single of her own.  It's true she didn't have a lot of say as far as the writing and producing songs.

But i believe that will come with time and more experience in the music business.  I look forward to that but as for her cd now.  It's a solid interpretation of her tastes and different styles with songs like ""If This Isn't Love"" or the sassy and spirited ""Pocketbook"" w/Ludacris (who brings his A-game on this song).  Also of note are the songs ""My Heart"", ""I'm His Only Woman"" w/(fellow AI alum) Fantasia that has them both sparring for the title of the only woman in this guys life.

I also found myself enjoying the songs ""We Gon' Fight"" and ""Invisible"" as showing other sides of Jennifer Hudson's abundant talent and with more time and experience.

I've always been more of a casual fan of these guys compared to Rob, but after hearing this album, man, I did not expect them to deliver a great album, but they have!

I can't remember the last time I heard an album I listened to from start to finish without skipping a track or two... but even when I almost did about two times on this album, I didn't! After hearing the whole album now, there is only about 2 tracks I don't think where that great, but for the most part every song on this album has gotten at minimum a 3/5 rating from me. A first in quite some time!

It's also funny, because a lot of this album goes against what I do like, so Powerman 5000 have definitely proven themselves as being able to utilize sounds and effects that usually just give me an instant headache and put me in a bad mood that anybody is allowed to use them at all, but these guys have gotten away with it!

My only criticism is saying good luck trying to play some of these songs live, as there is quite alot of effects, echoes, mixing, you name it, everything seems to have been used.

I was already impressed and rockin to the album on the first listen up until track 5 (builders of the future), then dreaded techno noises kicked in, and I cringed, however, by the time the song was over, it wasn't that bad! I give it 3 stars, but I do know there is an audience for it, and it wouldn't surprise me if that song charts! It's the kind of thing that would these days. Not my cup of tea personally, but like I said, I give it 3 stars, which is high considering I usually give techno -1 stars before even hearing it. That song wouldn't surprise me if it charts, the people who like a majority of what chart music is today love the song, then look confused when they hear the rest of Powerman 5000's material. It seems to be a song that doesn't quite fit in with the rest of Powerman 5000's back catalog, but yet it's not so far out of place I would say it does not belong on the album or anything.

The second half of the album kicks off with a slow number ( I want to kill you), which was putting me to sleep until the chorus kicked in and I just got what it was about. Interesting, but not something I will listen to much in future. After that was up and down of 3 to 4 star material!

Excellent work from Powerman 500 here. Like I said before, I've been a casual fan, mostly due to only finding a couple of tracks from previous albums that I loved, but this album here, this has moved up Powerman in my favorite bands list. To me, this is certainly the best overall album the band has done. I may not have found a new favorite song by these guys to replace ""Blast Off"" or ""Nobody's Real"" but something on this album is definitely going to grow on me soon enough to become my 3rd favorite... and probably 4 to 10 as well!

With the 1980s being a particularly ripe era for nostalgia these days, it only makes sense that the French electronic/indie band's latest album, ""Junk,"" takes inspiration from the years that seem to have informed their sound and aesthetic the most. If you felt a twinge of sadness when you learned that George Gaynes had passed earlier in the year, or if you remember a time when Dic productions ruled the TV set, ""Junk"" may be the album for you.

It would be hard to talk about ""Junk"" without comparing it (admittedly unfavorably) to 2011's mammoth double-disc ""Hurry Up, We're Dreaming."" Band leader Anthony Gonzalez aimed to outdo himself (and perhaps his peers) with the aforementioned album and succeeded in big, booming ways. Five years later, and the release of the tepid first single, ""Do It, Try It"" and it's hard not to feel disappointed at first. However, ""Do It, Try It"" appears to be a red-herring, meant to downplay any expectations, since the album quickly picks up speed with the caffeinated power-anthem ""Go!"". Teasing a little bit of that signature sax from prior hit, ""Midnight City"" before dipping into an absolutely infectious chorus from guest vocalist Mai Lin (who appears on two later tracks), it's made clear that the M83 we have come to love hasn't died or gone dormant, it's just taken on a new form.

Speaking of new, newbie band member Jordan Lawlor gets to take lead vocal duty on the smooth summer breeze of ""Walkway Blues,"" injecting some energy into the band's music while Gonzalez takes a backseat in the vocal department. Likewise, ""Time Wind"" allows Beck (yes, THE Beck) to lead the group through one of the high points on the album. Having proven himself to be one of the most diverse musicians of his generation, Beck slides into the slipstream so effortlessly, it makes one desire an M83-produced Beck album immediately (seriously, somebody make this happen!)

Like a bowl of cereal sitting in one's lap for too long during a Saturday morning cartoon binge-watch, bits of ""Junk"" tend to get a bit soggy. While brevity has never been M83's thing, the album leans on the overly-long side and starts to feel a little samey in the last third. Even still, the peaks overwhelm the valleys and while it doesn't always flow as well as the three albums preceding it, there are a number of gems in ""Junk""'s trunk. So strap on a pair of Moon Boots, ready the Lik-M-Aid and transport yourself back to a time when the ""Ghostbusters"" tearing up your local multiplex were a bunch of dudes, and enjoy the time wind.",Saturdays = Nostalgia,1469232000,

What can I say -- you tend to stick to the music you grew up with.  But after hearing from multiple sources that ""Africa"" was one of their best, I decided to give it a listen.  Turns out I'd heard it before, I just hadn't known the title or connected it to Toto at all.  And while I still prefer ""Rosanna"" over ""Africa,"" ""Africa"" is still a very enjoyable song, and makes me want to check out more by the band.

""Africa"" is a nice upbeat song, a well-done mix of pop and rock with a tune that's pleasant to listen to and good vocal harmonies.  The lyrics are somewhat generic -- despite the occasional Africa references (such as Kilimanjaro), it seems more like a generic love song than anything else.  Still, as another well-known band likes to say, ""some people wanna fill the world with silly love songs, and what's wrong with that?""

A beautiful mid-tempo from Miss India. Arie. This is definitely in my top 2 favorite songs by her. In fact, if you were to ask me what song is better than this one from her first two albums and a few of the tracks from her third, I'd say this one takes the cake.

It just doesn't get more contemporary soul-ish than this. The runs and the deep notes are so amazing on this track. And it means that much more when you actually know like all the lyrics to the song!

Other songs with meaning recommended (all by India):

Nature (Acoustic Soul)
Slow Down (the remaining three are from her second album, Voyage To India)

This project has been in the making for many years now.  I have to express my gratitude to them for finally releasing it.  First off, from the jump, the production on this album is no joke.  Southern Lights takes the duo on a journey filled with danger, temptations, forgiveness, and perseverance and hope.  We travel the roads from the suburbs of the South hearing the testimony and struggle that emerged Midwest.  Alex and Dre give voice to the disparity and racial stereotypes shared by the inhabitants of their hometowns.  As far as the album's length is concerned.  Which can be a hit or miss in this situation.  Southern Light clocks in under 43 minutes.

  Alex and Dre paid dues to be where they are in Christian and HIp Hop worlds.  Unwavering in their commitment to make meaningful music and sharing the Gospel.  Both are disciplined in their storytelling ability.  Reminiscent of Outkast, the way they share roles, and spit on solo outings.  Guest features from Sean C. Johnson, ADA-L, add their passion and artistic merit on the album.  They contributions are not to be missed.  You will also get insightful lyricism, chants/hooks and raw energy from Young Noah, Tragic Hero  and Corey Paul.  Because of the length of the album you'll repeat most of these songs anyway.  The guitars, keyboard synths, beat elements are blended professionally and should be noted. There's no denying the stomping ground our boys call home.  My definitive favorite tracks  are Wake Up Music, Overexposed,  All Around The World, Money, Taking Time, and City of Nightmares II.  This remastered or remixed version of Decatur Street Blues doesn't hype me up as much as  the single did.  I get the feeling that both artists held back something.  Perhaps a track with all fellow Ws Live As Kings bandmates was a pretty tall order to fill.

In summation,  you should definitely check out Southern Lights.  This record sheds light in the dark places that Alex and Dre have tread.  These two illuminate the light of Christ without fail.  I'm definitely keeping my ears further open to the music that Collision Records have planned.  Thank you Alex Faith and Dre Murray.

There's not much to say about this release really. For the most part Springfield stays true to the original arrangements of the songs, albeit for a different guitar or piano tone here and there. With the songs I recognize, ""I'm Not in Love,"" ""Life in a Northern Town,"" ""Broken Wings,"" ""Baker Street,"" ""Waiting for a Girl Like You,"" ""For No On,"" and ""Imagine,"" they sound just like the originals versions, except their being sung by Rick Springfield. All of the tracks chosen are mellow and flow nicely together. Rick is in great voice, but doesn't really challenge himself.

The Bad

It doesn't really make sense to include a new song (""Cry"") on a covers album, but at least it fits in with the rest. I would have liked to have heard a couple of slightly different versions or arrangements.

The Verdict

I know I've been a little critical of this album, but overall I like it. They're songs I know, from an artist I enjoy.

4,,False,"04 21, 2002",A1EKTLUL24HDG8,B00138JAD6,,Bill R. Moore,"This album was a great shock, understandably, to many people when it came out - almost as much as Self-Portrait was. For that reason, and for Dylan's subsequent backing off from his Born Again phase - which has since received a certain ""cornpone"" status in his mythology - this album is often overlooked by many people. Let me be honest: if it wasn't Bob Dylan who made this album, I probably never would've listened to it, much less bought it. I am not a religous person, and Gospel and Gospel-inflected music are not among my favorites. I held off on buying this and made it one of my last Dylan purchases. However, let me be the first to tell you that I was pleasantly surprised! Odd as it may seem, this album is actually a return for Dylan in many ways. Ever since Blood On The Tracks, Dylan had been dipping his toe into more and more complex musical visions - the international vibe of the Desire album, the Rolling Thunder Revue, the big band-addled Street Legal, and his subequent ""Vegas"" tour - and this album goes back to the stripped-down rock band arrangements that he had long been known for. Whether or not you like it as much as his previous two albums - I don't, personally - it's easy to see that it's more focused, more concise, and that Bob was way more into it. Here we see him, perhaps for the first time ever, trying his hardest to make his music as smooth, polished, and presentable as possible. Clearly, Dylan was trying to reach as many as people as possible with this album, something he had never cared about before. The production by Barry Beckett and Jerry Wexler on this album is immaculate, and still sounds great today. It sounds better than anything he has recorded and released since (with the exception of the re-mastered songs on Biograph.) It's a sad fact that Columbia has neglected the Bob Dylan catalog - without argument, their most important artist - with only one of his albums, Street Legal, being remastered; and this is one of his few albums that still sounds great today. Furthermore, Dylan took even greater steps: hiring the then-in vogue (and terrific) group Dire Straits to be his backing band, and going down to Alabama to record the album with the Muscle Shoals Horns and a full gospel choir. Although the music on this album is not his best, and certainly not his most original, it is a very tight, focused effort. Mark Knopfler has gotten props several times for his playing on this album, and it's easy to see why. The rest of the players, as well as the production, are top-notch as well. The album is not necessarily what you might expect lyrically, either. Certainly, it's steeped highly in Christian imagery and Biblical allusion, particularly that of the book of Revelation. But, Dylan had been weaving Biblical allusions into his lyrics for his entire caree - from early tracks like When The Ship Comes In to practically the entire album John Wesley Harding, to the deeply spiritual-leaning Street Legal. Of course, he had never approached it the way he does on here. They are not merely enrichening the songs, they ARE the songs. The lyrics can be a bit dogmatic at times - and, of course, self-righteous - but you can enjoy, and like, them regardless of your own personal set of beliefs. Even if you don't agree with the opinions expressed within, you can still appreciate them as art. They do often have a very arrogant ring to them - Bob is practically breathing fire and brimstone on some of the tracks! No less a figure than Nick Cave has gone on record as saying that this is his all-time favorite album, citing its ""anger and nastiness... certainly not like the thing you find on most Christian albums."" We get bitter, impassioned performances from Dylan on such songs as Gotta Serve Somebody and Slow Train. He hadn't been this focused and into his material since... well, quite a long time. You can tell he's really into it, and truly pouring his heart out into his vocals and his performances. Standout tracks include the Gotta Serve Somebody, a ""list"" song with some truly biting vocals from Dylan (it's just unbelievably cool to hear him stretch out that word ""somebody""), for which he won a greatly deserved vocal performance Grammy. Precious Angel is nothing less than a love song - a moving ode to the woman who turned him on to Christianity. Slow Train is an absolutely ferocious song that attacks corrupt politics - one of the album's sub-themes - while weaving in much distressing imagery from Revelation. I Believe In You is an absolutely beautiful song about unwavering faith (Dylan as JOB.) To be sure, not all the songs are of this quality, and some even border on embarrassing, now. Still, this is quite a good album, and an essential one for any Dylan fan. Whatever one might say about Dylan's conversion, one thing is certain: it re-invigorated him artistically, and got him interested in his work again and he turned out his most focused and concise album since Blood On The Tracks.",Underrated,1019347200,

The airy You Know I Have to Go floats around the atmosphere, before Save Me brings things back to earth. But I Had This Thing mixes the earthiness of the bass with the atmospherics for a track that straddles both worlds.

Hootie who? Despite being the front man of Hootie and the Blowfish, Darius Rucker has made himself such a name in country music that has made his days with the Hootie a distant memory. Not since Charley Pride has another African American country artist made such a squall on the country music front. Three consecutive number ones from his debut disc ""Learn to Live"" and garnering the New Artist Award at CMA have certainly firmly established Rucker as one of the mainstays of the genre. Sophomore follow -up ""Charleston, SC 1966"" ought to continue to give Rucker the same red carpet treatment of more awards and number one hits. Like his solo debut, ""Charleston, SC 1966"" continues on the same radio ready path of pop country with that occasional touch of southern charm. And just like his predecessor, Rucker has a hand in co-penning all these cuts with some of Nashville finest scribes including Brad Paisley, Ashley Gorley, Frank Rogers, Kara DioGuardi among many others.

Inspired by Radney Foster's 1992 landmark ""Del Rio, TX 1959"" where Foster names his Arista debut under the name of his hometown and date of birth, ""Charleston, SC 1966"" follows suit for Rucker. While Foster's release was a masterpiece of creative ingenuity, Rucker's counterpart is less adventurous. Not that it's a ropey effort. Rather, the songs are mostly safe and radio-targeted. Best tailored towards radio is lead single ""Come Back Song"" a sensitive mid-tempo acoustically driven ditty telling the story of a mildly depressed man trying to win back his paramour after committing some foolish mishaps. While the age-appropriate ""Might Get Lucky"" tells of a frustrated middle-aged husband trying to juggle between the kids and some fun time with the Mrs.. Brad Paisley joins Rucker in penning the randy ""I Don't Care"" that bares all the marks of Paisley's patented humor over a light-hearted but catchy tune.

There are a couple of soul-searching numbers including the hymn-like ballad ""We All Fall Down."" ""We All Fall Down"" truly showcases what a fine singer Rucker is especially in his impeccable delivery and his ability to emote the feelings of the song. ""She's Beautiful"" is another gorgeous ballad that testifies to man's contentment with his life and wife. Harkening back to his roots, ""Southern State of Mind"" is a ode to southern living (such as sweet tea and opening the door for the ladies) that ought to put a smile on anyone who has ever graced the south before. Nevertheless, the breakup song ""I Got Nothing"" and the dark bluesy ""Whiskey and You"" border on acceptable without being memorable. Although the Alan Jackson-influenced ""The Craziest Thing"" has a tad of added Cajun spice to it that ought to get our feet grooving to its infectious melody.

At the end of the day ""Charleston, SC 1966"" is a smooth, polished and enjoyable endeavor. And the songs all have a distinct southern feel to it that truly makes this as country as radio allows it. Nevertheless, the tracks are far too safe. It would have worked even better if Rucker loosen his grip on his pen a little--a few songs from other Nashville writers may elevate this from being relegated as a kiss radio effort.","Darius' Radio Friendly Tour Across ""Charleston, SC 1966""",1286841600,

Casual fan would be a better listener but I have always liked whatever songs I would hear on the song or saw on tv as a solo artist or when he was with White Zombie. I always liked his fusion of metal and industrial music. He also knew how to write a good hook to attract fans.

On a casual whim, I decided to pick up Rob's new album ""Educated Horses"". In general, ""Educated Horses"" is no ""Hellbilly Deluxe"" (my favorite Zombie album) but it still very good. I wasn't too keen on the slower tracks but songs like ""American Witch"" and ""Foxy Foxy"" reminds me why I have always liked Rob's music. His music is incredibly melodic yet he manages to maintain an aggressive metal/industrial edge to please those who like heavy, aggressive music. I especially love ""American Witch"". I have to listen to it as loud as I can. It is the closest thing to classic Zombie like ""Dragula"". As I have said before I wasn't keen on the slower songs. I prefer it when Rob growls than actually sings. My other beef with the cd is that it clocks under 40 minutes. A bit short for my taste. Overall ""Educated Horses"" is a lot of fun I think, especially when it is cranked up on the stereo.",Pretty good but flawed,1147478400,

The Arcade Fire are subjected to nothing different.  Like the beloved U2 (who are the slightest bit too hyped at times), The Arcade Fire use minimalistic progressions and production tactics to make grand songs.  Creativity runs rampant on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Suburbs/dp/B003O85W3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Suburbs</a>, surprisingly trumping the grand&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Neon-Bible/dp/B000MGUZM0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Neon Bible</a>&nbsp;at times.  While ""Intervention"" isn't necessarily bested, there are songs of nearly/if not the same level on 'The Suburbs'.

The album opens up superbly with the strong ""The Suburbs,"" where frontman Win Butler's vocals are their most clear and present - not to mention his grand falsetto on the refrain  (""sometimes I can't believe it/I'm moving past the feeling again"").  ""The Suburbs"" benefits from a fine and haunting production work filled with strings, electric and acoustic guitars, and piano.  ""Ready to Start,"" a personal favorite cut, maintains a driving groove and contrasts the mid-tempo groove of ""The Suburbs."" Again, the superb songwriting lends a catchy refrain (""If I was scared, I would, and If I was bored (broke, pure, etc.), you know I would, If I was yours, I'm not... now I'm ready to start."" 'The Suburbs' bats a thousand with ""The Suburbs"" and ""Ready to Start.""

""Modern Man"" finds the band dabbling in asymmetrical meter and once again a minimal harmonic progression provides the backdrop for Butler's vocals.  Not quite as epic as ""The Suburbs"" or ""Ready to Start,"" its still a fine cut.  ""Rococo"" loses no momentum, while ""Empty Room"" is an interesting listen, if a bit hard to decipher.  Regin Chassagne, wife of Butler leads the charge vocally but the busy production work overtakes her vocals.  This cut would've benefited from being mixed slightly better, but maybe the cacophonous effect was what the band had in mind.

""City With No Children"" proves to be much better featuring a notable bass line and a clever groove.  On ""City With No Children,"" the religious allusions come full circle as Butler sings ""feel like I've been living in, a city with no children in it, a garden left to ruin..."" ""Half Light I"" and ""Half Light II (No Celebration)"" are two contrasting cuts, both worthy of a couple of spins.  On ""Half Light I"" Regin Chassagne is the main focus, where her lovely vocals are better produced this go-round.  On ""Half Light II (No Celebration), "" Butler takes the reigns, with Chassagne's vocals harmonizing mid-way through the first verse, mixed in the background.

""Suburban War"" stands out, if mainly because of its stylistic changes at given points within the track.  ""Month of May"" finds Arcade Fire channelling ""punk rock"" to an extent  with its driving guitar work and Butler's raw vocals.  ""Wasted Hours"" doesn't necessarily stand out, but it is another solid number.  ""Deep Blue"" and ""We Use To Wait"" are both Arcade Fire cuts at their best.  On ""Deep Blue,"" the guitars take on a ""garage"" sound and the piano twinkles make this cut reminiscent of a saloon or lounge.  ""We Use To Wait"" makes clever use of a minimalistic piano figure and clever songwriting.
""Sprawl I (Flatland)"" turns out to be a languid, dark cut exploiting a vulnerable sounding Win Butler while its sister cut ""Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)"" sounds as if it could have been equally at home on MGMT's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Congratulations/dp/B0037W68F4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Congratulations</a>. ""Sprawl II"" is a worthwhile cut if for no other reason than it contrasts everything else that Arcade Fire has released at this point.  Kudos for that.  A reprise of ""The Suburbs (Continued)"" closes the album.

'The Suburbs' is easily one of the top albums of 2010.  Here, Arcade Fire deliver an album that is both captivating and different from their previous effort.  No wonder the Canadian based band debuted atop the Billboard Album Charts.  4 stars.",One of 2010's BEST albums,1283904000,

I am really not into disco music but there is something about Donna Summer that bring out your inner love for disco. I will be honest she and the Bee Gees are the only ones from the disco era I care to listen to. The one thing about Donna Summer, to me she just isn't considered disco but also pop. Just like the Bee Gees I guess. I love a lot of her music, but this song is one of her best. I love the lyrics and the background music is killer. I recently heard it watching America Hustle; and was stoked. She, like Micheal Jackson will last forever, music wise. This song is great for anybody who likes old school tunes this is a downloader; and for you newbies listen to the sample on Amazon, you will love the beat.

His body of work has rivaled many in the music industry- even if at times the sales didn't match the acclaim. He made a lasting impression on Wu-Tang Clan's debut ""Enter The Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)"". He took things a step further by appearing on another classic album- this time on half the songs on Raekwon's ""Only Built 4 Cuban Linx..."". His time came in 1996 with his Gold selling RZA produced debut ""Ironman"", which featured the singles ""Daytona 500"" and the personal song about living in poverty ""All That I Got Is You"". After a four year wait- mostly due to constant pushbacks- he released his long awaited sophomore effort ""Supreme Clientele"". He followed it up with his third and final album for Epic Records- 2001's ""Bulletproof Wallets"". By 2004, he ended up on Def Jam- where he would put out a lot of material but some of the albums never got the attention they deserved (See: ""The Pretty Toney Album"" and it's predecessor ""Fishscale""). He issued the disappointing ""The Big Doe Rehab"", followed by his long talked about R&B album ""Ghostdini: Wizard Of Poetry In Emerald City"". His final album for Def Jam, 2010's ""Apollo Kids"" was well received, despite the little to no promotion from the label.

In 2012, he signed with The RZA's independent label Soul Temple Entertainment. He made his debut on the label on the soundtrack to the martial arts film ""The Man With The Iron Fists""- a film directed by The RZA and executive produced by Quentin Tarantino. His first project under Soul Temple was the concept album ""Twelve Reasons To Die"". The album was produced solely by Adrian Younge, who also produced the soundtrack to the blaxploitation parody ""Black Dynamite"". From there, they created an album that was based around the comic book also called ""Twelve Reasons To Die"". While it is a hip hop album, the production is deep rooted in early 1970's northern soul. He works with several members of the Wu-Tang family, such as Inspectah Deck on the song ""Blood On The Cobblestones"" as well as ""An Unexpected Call (The Set Up)"". Masta Ace appears twice also- first on ""I Declare War"" and again on ""Revenge Is Sweet"". He teams up with half of Wu-Tang Clan on the song ""Murder Spree"", although his onetime rhyming partner Raekwon is noticeably absent. After sampling a song by The Delfonics on his 2004's ""The Pretty Toney Album"", lead singer William Hart returns the favor on the sinister ""Enemies All Around Me"". Lastly, Ghostface gets help from Cappadonna on the ballad about an untrustworthy woman ""The Center Of Attraction"". ""Twelve Reasons To Die"" is a soiid recording from Ghostface Killah. While it's not as strong as his earlier works, it's definitely one to add to the catalogue.","Ghostface Killah teams up with Adrian Younge for ""Twelve Reasons To Die""",1372032000,

I definitely do not think Michael Jackson forgot all the years he was judged as a pedophile and wacko jacko. Still he still had some great songs towards the end of his career and his life. You Rock My World, one of his last hit songs originally from the lackluster Invincible album is still one of those few standouts from that album that is playing well. It showed a more R&B rhythm to the appeal that Michael Jackson wanted to get into a generation that was getting into Destiny's Child, TLC and when a lot of R&B really was going more into a dance and hip hop rhythm. It really was a good song, but one of Michael Jackson's last to really hit the nail on the head. If you would prefer Michael's music from the afterlife, as it was released from the Xscape record, you should absolutely go back to what made Michael Jackson a legend in the first place, and get Invincible with You Rock My World.

It has not only been sad, it shows that the music industry has missed on great songs. That thankfully doesn't stop Chrisette Michele from making good songs. That has shown from her latest album Epiphany, and its title track Epiphany (I'm Leaving.) The song really brings in the soul appeal she hasn't lost after her debut I Am showed. It really is a short but simple song that mixes nicely from Chrisette's Jazzy Souldul voice, with a mix of Modern R&B sounds. The song is a nice breath of fresh air, especially from the lack of great music on the radio right now. I like the song, and I definitely love the album too.

But when it has came down to her, she has had a few strong surprises up her sleeve that have let her voice sincerely flow.

She delivers a more natural tone with her ballad very intimately, unlike more oversatured divas like Rihanna and Beyonce' have made in their songs. I was pleasantly surprised with the song from Jill. It definitely is a better ballad than what has shown to brew on radio. While everything lately on radio has been so much about Lady Gaga, what Jill has is a more natural feeling with her voice.

This album is a testament to those comments. While Snoop is not really rapping at all on this album it still has a Snoop Dogg vibe going. Pharrell handles the production for the most part and they have good chemistry. Its a fun album and should get a lot of play in the summertime. Snoop has always had songs where he harmonizes and I think this album is what Ego Trippin was trying to be. Snoop is so cool he can pull something like this off and it not sound forced or corny. This is his The Love Below album I guess but its str8 Doggystyled on a more mature tip though. I'd give this album a 3.75. So I rounded it off to 4 stars.

If I were to give my honest and objective opinion about Rock 'n' Roll, I would say that it surely is not Buckcherrys best album; I wouldnt classify this as their worst either, but it leaves quite a bit to be desired.

Buckcherry has been a favorite band of mine since their debut album dropped in 1999. I followed them intently until they disbanded after their Time Bomb album in 2001, but actually felt that they released their strongest material starting with 15 in 2005. I enjoyed most of their album up till Confessions a couple years back, and man, since then they have steadily continued to decline in my eyes. This brings me to their newest effort Rock 'n' Roll, and what I feel they did well, and maybe not so well.

The most notable thing about this record is that Buckcherry seems to make an effort  albeit a seemingly small effort- to return to their sleaze-rocking past. Songs like The Madness and Bring it Back ooze that sleazy vibe that made these guys stick out, while Sex Appeal has a classic Van Halen vibe that makes it a favorite of mine. The rest of the album is where the problems lay for me: bad songs, horrible song writing, and just too many mid-tempo filler songs. Now when I say filler, I absolutely mean songs that are there simply to take up space and time on an album. Tracks like Wood and Tight Pants seem like they could have been written by my six year old nephew, while a myriad of mellow songs reach a cheese factor that could make 80s hair bands laugh (and 80s hair metal is my favorite music).

The album is actually not all that terrible when you give it a couple listens. It most assuredly is not 15 or Black Butterfly, and thats fair, but sometimes you have to wonder if that special something that Buckcherry had at one point is now a thing of the past.","An album that could make some happy, but could also disappoint a lot of fans as well",1441065600,

My big surprise was the amount of careful work that went into this followup. The only reason this cd doesn't rate a ""5"" in my opinion is that she could have done it entirely without vocoder effects and it would have still been great. After all, I buy her music to hear HER.
""Song For The Lonely"" will be as big, if not bigger, than Believe. And there are several potentials for Top 10 to follow. Check out the infectious ""Different Kind Of Love Song"", the haunting ""Rain Rain"", anthemic ""Alive Again"", the 70's  disco ""Love Is A Lonely Place Without You"", and a great cover of ""Love One Another"".

They always had this side to them and you heard a lot of this on Mantis. Death by Stereo found them retaining their genre hopping ways but becoming more commercial. Similar Skin still finds the band genre hopping but it does sound like they've been listening to some Rush as you can hear their influence peppered throughout, especially on ""The Linear"", ""Puppet String"", and the title track. One thing about this album's harder nature is that is shows a welcome return of Jake Cinninger and Brendan Bayliss' guitars back to the forefront. But as usual, the band throws you a curveball and a gem at that with the excellent ""No Diablo"".

From this point, progressive rules the day best evidenced on ""Educated Guess"" and ""Bridgeless"".

4,,True,"09 20, 2008",A6FIAB28IS79,B0013DCCS6,,Samuel C.,"This is not the cacophonous circus that two big bands playing together (for the first time, without rehearsal, and in one 12-hour session) might have become.  Think of it as one large ensemble (like Kenton's 40+ piece mellophone orchestra) commanded by a first captain (Ellington) and two assistant directors (Basie and Strayhorn).  Basie, the spokesperson for understatement, and Ellington, the supreme creator of small ensembles within larger ensembles: the result is sensible, swinging, and frequently exhilarating music--with enough spontaneity to satisfy even a Charles Mingus.

In fact, Mingus was the only musician the ultra permissive Ellington ever fired from his band--at the insistence of Juan Tizol, after the volatile bassman had come at the trombonist with a fire ax.  On the occasion of this recording, Tizol again insisted that Ellington fire someone--trumpeter Cat Anderson, who had nearly sliced off his head with a spiraling Sam Woodyard cymbal. "" It's him or me,"" said Juan.  Ellington may have been agreeable, but the Maestro was not about to submit to an ultimatum issued in public by his trombonist.  So ""First Time"" was the last time for Juan Tizol.

Musical highlights include some heated exchanges between the two bands' top soloists, especially Thad Jones vs. Cat Anderson, and Frank Foster + Frank Wess vs. Paul Gonsalves (who could hold his own in any company).  Also, Wess' flute (an instrument that didn't interest Ellington) and Jimmy Hamilton's clarinet do a memorable ""pas de deux.""  At the same time, not bringing together the lead altoists--Johnny Hodges and Marshall Royal--is a wasted opportunity.  On the whole, the affair favors Basie over Ellington, whose subtle, nuanced palette and sophisticated compositional genius are less apparent than usual.  The Freddie Green rhythm guitar would all but clinch it as a primarily Basie date were it not for the rich percussive colors and personal back-beat (as opposed to Sonny Payne's broader stroke) of Sam Woodyard.

A minor disappointment is the audio on this 2008 edition.  There's some breaking up of the sound during the climactic ensemble passages of the main burner, ""Battle Royal.""  Perhaps mine is a defective copy, because after the perfect sound of the digitalized and reissued ""Ellington at Newport 1956,"" a buyer would have the right to expect as much of a 1962 date.  Otherwise, the reissue presents complete tracks for the first time and adds 11 tracks to the 8 on the original album.  The notes are copious, informative, and frequently absorbing.

Like the Ellington/Coltrane meeting, this is not an Ellington essential, but then again it's one no fan of either member of the royal pair would want to be without.",A Royal Ball (one casualty),1221868800,

She has had a lot of good songs, but radio started to ignore her from her last album Girl On Fire. While she did have some great songs like Brand New Me, and New Day, which were very strong and soulful from her strong voice, Alicia was still overshadowed from the sever overexposure of artists like Rihanna and Beyonce' Knowles. But it still has slowed Alicia down from making great music. In Common is Alicia Keys' first new song in four years and definitely a nice return from the Soulful pianist and songwriter. The song is definitely a very spiritual rhythm that definitely sounds unlike anything Alicia has performed in a long while. It is a really good song, and honestly better than the products that have been overplayed on radio today whom stopped knowing what great music is like. The song reminds me of the Sting's hypnotic song Desert Rose from the late 90's, and showed a side of him that really was electrifying at heart. If you are a die hard Alicia Keys fan, you'll definitely like this song, and it is a good treat for anyone whom is just so tired of the so-called jokes of R&B like Ciara and Rihanna.

While the first album had more of a garage band edge to it, the follow-up finds the band shedding away some of their punkier second-rate Nirvana influences in favor for a much more polished and radio-ready sound. This should come as no surprise though, as Flyleaf are one of those rare rock bands nowadays who can sell a record and since their debut was a bit raw and immature.

Touring heavily with the likes of Korn and Disturbed has done little to soften the band's strong Christian themes. In fact, on ""Memento Mori,"" such moments are much clearer than ever. For some this could be a turn-off, but for the (ahem) faithful followers, it may be a plus. Put plain and simple, Lacey loves Jesus and wants to make sure you know all about it. Putting that aside, though, the album is certainly a notch above the first as far as musicianship goes. While the band has yet to establish a distinctive style, they back up Lacey's broad themes and unique voice well, and Benson's improved production only serves to give the whole affair more bombast and sonic improvements. Put simply, this is the same Flyleaf you know already, just marginally improved and perfected.

If ""Memento Mori"" has one fatal flaw, though, it's that the songs tend to blend into one another without a single moment sticking out. While there isn't necessarily a bad song to be found, it can be an overall taxing album to listen to and certainly begs the question of whether or not it will continue Flyleaf's string of success. At the end of the day, their second effort improves on almost all fronts, leaving memorable song-writing on the back-burner. Chalk it up to a burnt-out producer (seriously, what album HASN'T Howard Benson produced this year?) and a slightly immature band. Hopefully album number three irons out some of the wrinkles, but in the meantime, this will suffice.

The deluxe edition features four bonus tracks: ""Break Your Knees,"" ""Enemy,"" ""Have We Lost"" and ""Who Am I"". ""Break Your Knees"" and ""Have We Lost"" sound like it would fit right in with the first album, while ""Enemy"" meanders along rather blandly. ""Who Am I,"" on the other hand, sticks out and would probably make a good single -- if it weren't for the fact that it is so short. These tracks are worth owning for the fans who can't get enough of the band, but don't neccessarily improve the album as a whole.

He has been doing it for 30 years on his own, and nearly 40 years as a part of The Police. I do however find his solo work to really deliver nicely from Jazz and Soul to all the way to Rock. But when he has a song come out, people will really listen to him, most of the time. When it came down to his Brand New Day album in 1999, many people weren't very eager at listening to the album at first, after the title track was released. However when Desert Rose was released as a single, many people really flocked over to the album. Desert Rose from the Brand New Day album is one of those hypnotic songs of Sting's that is soulful and very hypnotic to his work. I definitely think it is one of his Top 5 songs to have ever came out in the 90's. Next to If I Ever Lose Me Faith In You and Fields Of Gold.

There is nothing incredibly risky or truly innovative on HUMAN, but it is one of those solid R&B albums. It does fall off a bit towards the end and all the dance mixes are not necessary, but overall it flows extremely well.

""The Definition"" opens the album strongly, if not necessarily exceptionally following the ""Human Intro"".  ""Warm It Up (With Love)"" is an instant hit with the thumping drums and melodious piano to accompany it. Songwriting is strong at this point and continues on with first single, ""Right Here (Departed), a fine track.  ""Piano Man"" is solid too, even if it falls short of the perfection of ""Warm It Up (With Love)"" or ""Right Here (Departed)"".  ""Long Distance"" (following the interlude of the same title) is perhaps the valedictory performance of HUMAN - I have never heard Brandy sound so polished and refined vocally as this chilling performance. Honestly, ""Long Distance"" deserves a nod at the 2010 Grammys for best Female R&B Vocal Performance - that good.

""Camouflage"" is strong, but has tough competition to follow after the brilliant ""Long Distance"".  ""Torn Down"" is forgettable in comparison to the strongest material, though ""Human"" and ""Shattered Heart"" pick up the slack. ""True"" is enjoyable while ""A Capella (Something's Missing)"" has to be the set's most perplexing listen.  I would not call it a hit, but it is unique and worth a couple of spins if for nothing else but to analyze it. ""1st & Love"" is another clear hit, while ""Fall"" works very well too.  ""Long Distance"" and ""Right Here (Departed)"" are made into dance mixes at the end of the album (take them or leave them!)

Overall HUMAN is a strong effort with minor flaws.  There are no backsteps Brandy has taken from the excellent, underrated Grammy nominated 2004 effort, AFRODISIAC. Vocally, she is stronger here than that album and the production from ""Darkchild"" is top-notch.

Upon listening it becomes clear very quickly she has not only the voice but also the songs to back up this confidence.

If I didn't know any better, I'd have just as easily guessed this was from 1978 than 2005, sharing as it does a real kinship in sound to (then) emerging singers like Chrissie Hynde, Debbie Harry and in particular Kate Bush. Like Bush's debut 'The Kick Inside', arrangements here swoon and soar, choruses surprise and there's an almost frightening level of intensity at times, which makes for riveting listening throughout. It's also an album that's unafraid to tackle difficult subject matter, though for me, much of it is simply about attempting to transcend life's limitations.

Harrison,"I've criticised Sonny's last couple of records for being a bit too lightweight and 'poppy', despite still having his state-of-the-art slide guitar playing. On this record he goes back to the blues, with versions of traditional blues such as Robert Johnson's ""Walkin' Blues"", Tampa Red's ""It Hurts Me Too"", Elmore James' ""Dust My Blues"", Skip James' ""Cherry Ball Blues"" and the old blues chestnut ""Key To The Highway"". All these songs are well-known and have been covered many many times but Sonny still manages to bring something new to them - with both his excellent guitar playing and also impassioned vocals - while playing them more-or-less straight and not trying to reimagine them or be too flashy. ""Firebird Blues"" is a nice, moody instrumental tribute to the late Johnny Winter and his guitar of choice.

Sonny's own songs which round out the record also reflect the slightly tougher blues sound of the classics, with the title track name-checking Muddy Waters and ""The High Side"" having a lighter, more acoustic sound. Although I liked the final track the instrumental ""Simcoe Street"", again I felt that all his own songs here seem just a bit too familiar, with sounds and melodies we've heard him play before. However, overall I thought that this was a good combination of some beautifully-played traditional blues and Sonny's own more melodic and thoughtful compositions, and (rather surprisingly) I'll choose the immaculately-played ""Dust My Blues"" as my favourite track.",Bringing something new to the blues...,1433808000,

You'll remember last time on ""The Days Of Our Yes"", it was 2008, and the prog-rock soap opera known as Yes had just had a line-up change AGAIN, though this latest line-up change has really, and I mean *really* rubbed some of the band's fanbase the wrong way. It was bad enough to lose everybody's favorite Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman (AGAIN), who left (AGAIN) to pursue other music projects, but not only that, highly-worshipped lead singer Jon Anderson was forced to bow out of the band's planned 40th anniversary tour due to poor health. Did the rest of the band do the decent thing and wait for Jon to get better? Nope. Determined to tour and move on, they replaced him with a younger singer named Benoit David from the Yes tribute band Close To The Edge, and on they went (first with keyboardist Oliver Wakeman, son of Rick, and now with ""Drama"" keyboardist Geoff Downes returning behind the keys once more). And now, after 10 long years, Yes have a brand-new studio album, ""Fly From Here"", with former ""Drama"" singer Trevor Horn reeled back in as producer (and look, serendipity, we've got the Buggles in Yes again!). Yup, it's the ""Drama"" thing happening all over again. Some fans have been very supportive of the new Yes line-up, while other fans have deserted amidst cries of ""No Jon, no Yes!"". Which brings us to the new album itself....

I'll cut to the chase: if you like ""Drama"" (a.k.a. you're open to a Jon Anderson-less Yes), then you'll like ""Fly From Here"" just fine. If you *don't* like ""Drama"" (you know, the ""No Jon, no Yes!"" mentality rearing it's head in you), then skip ""Fly From Here"". It's that simple really. I could probably end my review right there, but I'll go on a little bit more....

Considering that this is practically the return of the ""Drama"" Yes line-up, it's no surprise that ""Fly From Here"" could easily be renamed ""Son Of Drama"". It sounds pretty similar to that earlier 1980 album---how can it not? However, in my opinion, this is not at all a bad thing, 'cause I like ""Drama"" very much, always have. With all due love & respect to the great Jon Anderson, Yes are not The Jon Anderson Band. Yes are Yes. Even though there's no disputing that Anderson has made the far-greatest impression as lead singer for this band, I enjoyed Trevor Horn's vocal contributions on ""Drama"", and now, I like Benoit David's vocals on ""Fly From Here"". David actually sounds more like Horn than Anderson, but that's fine. I think he does an excellent job at the microphone (ah, but will he get to sing on another Yes album, or will he be a one-off like Horn was? Only time will tell). As for the Yes veterans, despite being in their 60's now, bassist Chris Squire, guitarist Steve Howe, drummer Alan White and returning keyboardist Geoff Downes all deliver the goods here and they still have wonderful musical chemistry. The songs are excellent---the epic title suite simply glows from start to finish, with great interplay from everyone. ""The Man You Always Wanted Me To Be"", with Squire on vocals, is the most ""poppy"" song on the album, but it's very catchy and heartfelt, and works quite well. ""Life On A Film Set"" is a powerful number, and ""Hour Of Need"" is wonderfully upbeat. Steve Howe's solo guitar piece ""Solitaire"" is a gem, and the finale, ""Into The Storm"", is a great, breezy rocker. And for the icing on the cake, Trevor Horn's production on the album simply sparkles.

The only thing that makes me deduct a star from my rating of ""Fly From Here"" is the overall sense I get that the album falls *just short* of masterpiece status, as it sounds like ""Son Of Drama"". Still, this is a very, very solid, excellent Yes album nonetheless, and I, for one, am willing to give this latest incarnation of Yes a chance. It's quite obvious that ""Fly From Here"", like ""Drama"" before it, ain't gonna satisfy every single Yes fan. Then again, the Yes fanbase has been heavily divided on every single album Yes have released since 1974's ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"", haven't they? (1972's ""Close To The Edge"" seems to be the last Yes album that *everybody* likes.) Yes will forever be a controversial band I suppose, but give these guys some credit---they DO have some great music all throughout their catalog, and not just on their first five albums, pre-""Topographic""!

4,36.0,True,"07 19, 2016",ALND45MWBGUQS,B01F9S6C54,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},Lunar Boulevard,"Ive been a Switchfoot fan ever since New Way to Be Human was released back in 1999. I can still remember the days of wearing a Switchfoot t-shirt to school and having hardly anyone recognize them. My wife even had a friend who made a bet that the band would never make it big because they were terrible. Shes still waiting on that $20 payment. Needless to say, Ive believed in this band for a long time and after 17 years I continue to do so, though my excitement has worn off a bit over the past few years. Where the Light Shines Through has a lot going for it, yet it also suffers some of the same problems that have plagued the groups previous records, leaving it in a difficult spot and leaving me with conflicted feelings.

The album starts off on a very positive note. Holy Water is a solid rocker, the kind of engaging anthem that the band has become known for and it grabs your attention immediately. Unfortunately Float really kills the momentum and takes the album into a left turn that feels unnatural. The song has grown on me over time but within the context of the album it feels forced; it should have been moved in the running order or saved for another project. Thankfully the albums title track and I Wont Let You Go keep things moving, with the latter being one of the albums best cuts. I have to give particular attention to If the House Burns Down Tonight, both lyrically and musically. It manages to be both catchy and intriguing, driving at a restless pace while looking at the differences between possessions and relationships. The Day That I Found God is equally beautiful. The first half of this album fares quite well and offers us a number of wonderful moments.

The second half feels patchier. Bull in a China Shop and Healer of Souls both fail to leave much of an impression even after numerous listens. Shake This Feeling and Live It Well feel a bit generic but work well enough for what they are. Looking for America is the weakest cut on this LP, a fact that the normally talented Lecrae cant save. It feels like what it is: a couple of artists complaining about America without offering any real solutions beyond surface level catchphrases. Sure, America is in trouble, but couldn't the band at least turn that into something more inspiring than the typical feel guilty because of the nations past rhetoric thats been far too prevalent over the past few years? I used to think Switchfoot was above that sort of thing but here they sound woefully out of their depth. Thankfully Hope Is the Anthem ends the album with a bang and continues the bands tradition of exhilarating closers.

Where the Light Shines Through is a bit inconsistent but musically it feels lively and diverse, with enough variety that even the pickiest of listeners should walk away satisfied. What holds the album back (at least for me) is the lyrics, which have been a problem for several records now. Jon Foreman knows how to write deep and convicting lyrics, as evidenced by tunes like The Economy of Mercy, The Shadow Proves the Sunshine and Company Car. That was one of the elements that drew me to the band initially and there are times when I still catch glimpses of it. The problem is that Jon rests on the same topics of love, hope, belonging, materialism, inner turmoil and rising up. Normally those topics are fine and even inspiring but by now I just feel that Jon has exhausted those subjects and used every variation imaginable to say essentially the same thing. Too often it feels like a line of generic catchphrases and muddy solutions, neither of which moves me on a deeper level. Love and hope are wonderful things but there are ways to branch out and present them from a fresh perspective. I just want the lyrics to be as interesting and diverse as the music. Tracks like If the House Burns Down Tonight prove they can still do it and it would be great to see more like it.

I apologize for a longer than normal review but I think Switchfoot is one of the best and most talented bands weve had in the past 20 years. Its out of love and care that I point out when the band isn't working because I want them to be the best they can be. Where the Light Shines Through is excellent in many respects---but the clich lyrics and uneven pacing hold it back from being truly great. My wife and I will be seeing them in September and it will no doubt be a marvelous experience. Id just like to see them push their lyrics and solutions as far as the music allows.",An Album on the Edge of Greatness,1468886400,

The cover image of Bjork with a gaping chest wound, provides a visual representation of the album's thematology. As for the curious title, when broken down, the latin words ""vulnus"" and ""cura"" respectively translate to ""injury"" and ""healing"". Though hardly a novel concept, Bjork takes this personal and introspective matter, and skillfully renders it universal, by creating an album in which to find solace, despite its heartbreaking content. After a long period of philosophical (and often pretty inaccessible) albums, she returns with the most human-centered album of her career, which, to those familiar with her work, is some kind of apocalypse. Especially, when considering that the record leaked, and was rush-released, a fact that seems to have done Bjork an inadvertent service, thus, allowing listeners to focus purely on the actual material. The album's 9 songs, chronicling the story of a relationship, are almost inextricably linked with one another. However, special mention has to be made for the album's glorious centrepiece, ""Black lake"", and the dramatic opener ""Stonemilker"". Reaching further than ever before, with ""Vulnicura"", Bjork proves that she is a phenomenal artist: wacky, weird, wondrous, wonderful.",71.

Hard to believe that it has been a decade since she broke big with her hit, ""Like A Star"" and ""Put Your Records On"" and she has been more cautious about trying to make as strong music as would be also with today's artists that have really chose to let the singles be heard first and not the album in full. Unfortunately, for Corrine that stride was put in sadness with the suicide death of her husband 8 years ago. She did come on strong with her second album, and songs like ""Paris Nights New York Mornings,"" which was deeply overshadowed in favor of more product singers like Rihanna and Beyonce'. Green Aphrodisiac, the lead single from her long-awaited third album, The Heart Speaks In Whispers, actually shows a bit more seductive side from Corrine as she tries and shows well, her intimate side with seduction and soul from the heart. It is a good song and shows a soft side of Corinne that works better from the heart, and shows she is just soulful from the voice alone. It is a good song, and worth the effort. Hopefully, there are more good songs like this one down the road from her.

The harmonies are great, and the songs themselves have a melodic and rhythmic catchiness whatever their emotional feel.  They're not all that varied, but they are different enough to make a good set, I think.  And there are some very good, witty lyrics here, especially in I Thought That We Said Goodbye and You Can't Call Me Baby which I think are exceptionally well done.

While the chances of the record making it big were slim, that didn't stop Steelheart from cranking out a butt-kicking party rock record.

I'll agree with some reviewer's here that said ""Tangled in Reins"" is not as good as the debut album. They are correct in some ways; however, this record is definitely worth adding to any pop-metal collection. With their sophomore album, Steelheart dropped some of the over-the-top campiness of the debut, and simply went for a more straight ahead rock approach. The change works well for the band on this album, and as with the debut, Michael Matijevic's vocals steal the show. ""Tangled in Reins"" doesn't have that ""I'll Never Let You Go"" type of hit on it, but the harder rocking approach adds a breath of much needed legitimacy to the band's repertoire. Songs like ""Sticky Side Up"" ""Loaded Mutha"" and ""Late for the Party"" are favorites of mine, but the rest of the album isn't totally terrible either.

I would recommend this to all fans of the late 80s/early 90s melodic rock scene. I'm sure that if anyone gave this record a couple spins they'd find something to make them smile pretty quick.","A little uneven, but it rocks anyways",1345248000,

But it's important to remember that Ghosts I-IV is NOT the next proper NiN release, and it should be viewed more accurately as a side project. Here Trent eschews lyrics and vocal melodies (his traditional Achilles heels) for 36 instrumental tracks that mostly provide atmospheres for not-so-easy-listening mood music, while highlighting Trent's sequencing and programming skills. It takes many, many listens for all of the tracks to differentiate themselves in your consciousness, but your patience will mostly be rewarded. Ghosts I-IV occasionally recalls the classic albums, delivering mood manipulation a la The Fragile (tracks #3, 11, 17, 28, 33); and surprisingly for this rather quiet collection, harsh Downward Spiral-like angst (#4, 8, 19, 23, 31). There are also a few experimental surprises that have not been heard from NiN before, such as weird bluegrass guitar (#14 - courtesy of Adrian Belew), pummeling rave (#16), old-school gangsta-hop (#24), bass-driven heavy funk-rock (#26, 27), and even vaguely Asian world music (#30).

But even with those occasional throwbacks and advances, many of the tracks on this release still have trouble rising above the pack. Primarily, almost all of the songs are just too short for their ideas to develop beyond basic introductions. In fact, just two tracks (#20, 34) feature more than one basic beat pattern or chord progression. And there are just too many weak tracks that turn moodiness into boredom - ranging from thin beat programming exercises (#9, 18), simple piano melodies propped up unsuccessfully with random noise (#10, 13, 22), and basic sequencer patterns that repeat to the point of absurdity (#6, 34). Of course, fans should feel as mellow and moody listening to Ghosts I-IV as Trent probably did while creating it. But at times there are just too many under-developed ideas vying for the listener's and the creator's attention. [~doomsdayer520~]",37 Review I-IV,1205798400,

While the song isn't bad, it definitely brings in a whole new light for Dave Grohl & company, and a whole new generation that has been interested in Lady Gaga.

It's their third collaboration with director David Fincher - in my opinion this score is not quite as good as ""The Social Network"" but is better than ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"".

It's a soundtrack that fits the film's suspense perfectly.  The music helps to build tension; that is its primary function.  But the score works well as an isolated listening experience as well (depending on your mood), in part because of its uniqueness/originality.  In fact, I would say that the soundtrack is as weird as the film itself - it's music that would only work for this one movie.

Recommended if you enjoyed the movie or if you were a fan of the previous efforts of Reznor/Ross.

For a band with such a self-deprecating sense of humor and such a choppy musical history, Type O Negative creates powerful, emotional music that transcends the goth stereotypes it wallows in (and helped create). And Peter Steele's dark vocals, once sort of a gimmick, have become integral to their brooding sound.

Anyway, like I said, ""October Rust"" is the best album ever. But the follow-up, ""World Coming Down"", was rather disappointing. I was losing hope for the band when their last album, ""Life Is Killing Me"", turned out to be a significant improvement. While not as uniformly brilliant as ""Rust"", it had some excellent songs and brought back their sense of humor. So I had high hopes for the newest release, ""Dead Again"".

The album is surprising in a lot of ways. First of all, many of the songs are much faster than previous Type O material. Peter doesn't sing quite so deep and gloomy this time around, and guitarist Kenny Hickey does much more singing than before. A few songs break the ten-minute mark, something they haven't really done since their first record. And while much of their sound remains typically Type O, many of the lyrics deal with new themes and ideas.

According to recent interviews, Peter Steele has returned to his Catholic upbringing, and so much of the album deals with Christianity and religion. ""The Profit of Doom"" uses an asteroid striking the Earth as a metaphor for the Apocalypse. ""These Three Things"" deals with abortion and the Jewish state of Israel. ""An Ode To Locksmiths"" offers a rather twisted version of Genesis. ""Halloween in Heaven"" is a bit lighter in tone, dealing with all the dead great musicians playing a concert in Heaven. And as usual, some of the songs are simply about Peter Steele himself and his personal problems. The title track ""Dead Again"" is about drug addiction, and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow"" deals with his anger management issues.

Thankfully, their sense of humor has not disappeared or been overwhelmed by the serious subject matter. I laughed out loud at some of the song titles, such as ""Tripping A Blind Man"" and ""Some Stupid Tomorrow,"" and several songs have some hilarious lines. Among my favorites:

""I had no pulse last time I checked / I'd trade my life for self-respect"" (from ""Dead Again"")

""Elvis ain't dead, so he isn't here"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

""If only I'd known how cool death is / I'd have killed myself sooner"" (from ""Halloween in Heaven"")

And let's not forget their album liner notes. The band photo from Life Is Killing Me featured four sets of feet with toe tags on them. Not to be outdone, Dead Again shows a picture of four mangled chalk outlines opposite photos of skeletons inside coffins. And in the section for equipment used, it says ""Type O Negative has yet to learn how to use the following equipment."" I always get a kick out of that sort of thing.

Even though I think ""Life Is Killing Me"" had some better individual songs than ""Dead Again"", I think ""Dead Again"" is a better album as a whole.  The whole tone of the album sounds more concise and uniform.  But that's just me.  It is a bit on the long side, but that's my only real complaint.

As a whole, fans of Type O should be happy with this release. The band they know and love has clearly matured over the years, but their style is undeniably intact. However, some people might be put off by the religious content of many of the songs. People bravely hoping for a return to ""October Rust"" territory will surely be disappointed as well. That era is gone, folks.",still not as good as october rust,1193875200,

A band that for the most part thought lost in the 80's since the acclaimed ""Crush"" and ""The Pacific Age"", they had a few album released in the 90's that tried to fit the sounds of the time but were for the most part ignored. Mounting a comeback in the 21st century would seem a daunting challenge but one OMD picks up none the less. History Of Modern harkens back to the well produced and thought out albums like Crush. The go back to their signature sounds of electronic strings and chorus-like vocals. Andy McCluskey and Paul Humphreys high tenor voices sound just as good as back then. They go back to topics they've covered before. Religious themes like Sister Marie Says (available for free at the OMD website) sounds like an updated version of Anola Gay.

Well she found a new love in her life and has taken some time off to raise her now two children so here we officially have the birth of Monica:the grown woman. The interesting part of this is,and the reason I will deduct a star from this album is that Monica has versatile vocal style that is more than a little suited to broader,funkier music. On the uptempo songs on this album,including the title song and songs such as ""Mirror"" Monica is producing herself with a very very generic commercial hip-hop sound that interesting enough forces her to sing at a pace a lot faster than normal to accomodate the brittle beats and because of the emphasis on beat rather than rhythm Monica's instrument is smothered by the need to speed up her singing and her special vocal qualities aren't as evident as they should be. Particularly difficult to listen to are the abrasive and by-the-numbers posturing rap on the title song which,even for someone like myself whose open minded to hip-hop kind of emphasizes a lot of the negative modern clishe's of the genre and isn't very welcoming musically. The rest of the album,however is a different story. Her interpretation of Evelyn King's somewhat unheralded ""If You Were My Man"" from the mid 80's get's an appropriate musical backup as Monica more fully explores her range. It's fitting that she chose a song by another former teen soul singer who not only helped pave the way for people like her but who managed to keep up with the times successfully even if her commercial fortunes often abandoned her. Even on the uptempo songs that lack in rhythmic intricacy the lyrics on this album are always arresting and compelling. On the midtempo ballad material such as the wonderful ""Once In A Lifetime"",""Superman"",""Love All Over Me"" and the closer ""Believing In Me"" the music takes on a slicker flavor that favors Monica's style a lot better than the overproduction on some of the faster tunes. On the concluding song her lyrics actually take on the topical stance of the modern 30 something and the general rebirth of the ""me"" generation wherein,for better or worse the selflessness involved in romantic relationships has again given way to a  ""me first"" attitude. Even though Monica means what she's saying,the reservation in her vocally delivery on the song isn't lost on me anyway. This is probably the best kind of album Monica could release at this particular time as contemporary R&B,stuck in a strong holding patter for the last decade or so is starting to adapt different elements into itself in order to keep itself fresh. If she expands the slicker elements of her music continually on her next album or two rather than keeps maintaining links to overly bomastic modern hip-hop productions she will definately be onto something.",Monica Believing In Herself,1281830400,

The country trio with enough chops to crossover to an inviting pop audience had one of the biggest albums of 2010 in regards to sales, critical response, and the music industry itself.  Unfortunately, many times, acts like Lady Antebellum get overhyped too much as does their respective release.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Need-You-Now/dp/B002WIDRM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Need You Now</a>&nbsp;proves to be a solid album by all means - and one of the year's better efforts - though the hype by fans and some outlets may be a bit overwrought.  That is nothing against the group who is a solid and polished collective by all means, but in reality, Lady Antebellum are nothing incredibly `new' to the industry - they are a solid act with a nice, restrained (sometimes too much so) sound that has incredible commercial appeal.  They are an alternative to groups such as Rascal Flatts and The Dixie Chicks (who are starting to show age by music industry standards).  None have to look any farther than first single and opening cut ""Need You Now"" to see why this once small group has grown into the ultimate commercial group to beat.

""Need You Now"" is the valedictory cut from Need You Now, though it is accompanied by some exceptional competition, surprisingly.  The production work here is brilliant, straddling country and pop worlds making this cut the #2 pop hit it was.  There is superb chemistry between vocalist Charles Kelley and Hillary Scott, who trade off between verses.  The pre-chorus (bridge before the chorus) is well penned (""and I wonder if I ever cross your mind, for me it happens all the time""), not to mention the classic chorus: ""It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now, said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control, and I need you now, and I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now"" Any doubters should be silenced by this exceptional cut that makes the non-country fan want to beg for more.

""Our Kind of Love"" is none too shabby itself, changing the pace after the moodier ""Need You Now.""  Here the band adheres to a `country' sound which lessens the appeal to the crossover audience built by ""Need You Now.""  The biggest quibble, however is the length of this cut as opposed to whether it is `country-sounding' or `pop-sounding.'  ""American Honey"" silences pundits quickly with beautiful production work through lush strings and superb songwriting once more.  Here, Hillary Scott is the featured vocalist, with Kelley's vocal turns mixed behind her (this happens throughout the album depending on who is truly `featured' between the two).  ""American Honey"" is one of many examples of the exceptional engineering of this album if nothing else.

""Hello World"" is a bit of a downgrade compared to the first three cuts, finding Charles Kelley's vocals lovely, yet too `sleepy' here at times.  The cut is pretty - don't get me wrong - but it just does not feel as inspired as pre-eminent cut ""Need You Now.""  Hillary Scot does not enter until nearly the 2:00 mark (mixed in the background for the most part). Only the dynamic ending truly atones for the lack of ""oomph"" with this cut.  ""Perfect Day"" atones for the missteps of ""Hello Word"" with a more driving groove and up-tempo feel here.  Also bowing in ""Perfect Day's"" favor is the brief duration at 3:20 and the production work.

""Love This Pain"" is solid, though a shade less enjoyable than the very best cuts.  Here, the highlights are the refrain and the superb bridge.  ""When You Got A Good Thing"" is the next noteworthy cut, however, giving ""Need You Now"" its first true taste of competition as the best cut.  This cut is a nice stripped-down ballad that features superb country instrumental ideas and straddles the line of soft-rock.  Again, songwriting makes a cut like this effective - not to mention some superb guitar playing by Dave Haywood, whose role can not be underwritten in the instrumental aspects of this album.

""Stars Tonight"" is a mid-tempo cut, that like the general pattern of this album does not stand out as the best, but is solid for the most part.  The vocal mix between Hillary Scott and Charles Kelley is spot-on as always. The track itself is enjoyable, but not revolutionary and is saved by the addition of a chorus backing Scott and Kelley's vocals near the end.  ""If I Knew Then"" again saves the day for a track less satisfying preceding it.  The six-feel is wonderful and a nice change of pace for the trio.  The songwriting is among the best of the album, yielding some wonderful lyrically driven moments: ""Cause love only comes, once in a while, knocks on your door, and throws you a smile, and takes every breath and leaves every scar/speaks to your soul, and sings to your heart..."" Like ""When You Got a Good Thing,"" it is one of few tracks to truly rival centerpiece cut ""Need You Now."" ""Something `Bout A Woman"" and ""Ready to Love Again"" are solid, but don't feel as relevant or solid as the best cuts from Need You Now.

All said, Need You Now is a good album that for the most part lives up to the hype that currently surrounds Lady Antebellum.  As stated prior, the hype is a bit much and this album is NOT without its flaws.  At times, the album sags and relies too much on restrained productions and songwriting conceptions that make the songs somewhat `same-y.'  Luckily,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Need-You-Now/dp/B002WIDRM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Need You Now</a>&nbsp;is packed with enough memorable moments and well crafted songs to atone and counteract the less remarkable moments and that is the mark of a group with considerable musicianship and a knack for marketing.

The Killers take their rep as last year's model and climb into a Pink Cadillac, which they floor the accelerator and beat a retreat from the glitz that one would associate with their home digs of Las Vegas and start screaming down the boulevard toward the East Coast and the Jersey Shore. Gone is most of the breezy 80's New Wave giddiness and in its place is....Bon Jovi's New Jersey? Yes, I have read the interviews where the ever cocky Brandon Flowers declares his newly discovered love for Bruce Springsteen, but frankly he is not anywhere close to that level of artistic acumen. So rather than get a five star extravaganza like ""Born In The USA,"" we get The Killers' approximation of ""Slippery When Wet.""

This is not a bad thing. It is obvious to me that The Killers are expanding their reach and desires. There are a couple moments of brilliance on ""Sam's Town,"" like the (excuse the pun) killer lead single ""When You Were Young."" The band brings the urgency of the ""Hot Fuss"" singles to lyrics that match up to their new found appreciation for Springsteen and make the jump from good songs to great songs. Same with ""Bones,"" a good song that gets extra cinematic punch from an Asbury Jukes styled horn chart, again making the leap to greatness.

But there are also moments where the reach exceeds the grasp. The ""Exitude"" and ""Enterlude"" bits are kind of silly. There are moments - like on ""This River Is Wide"" - when it sounds like Flowers is singing beyond his range. ""Sam's Town"" also hits the occasional lyrical snag, like on ""Bling (Confessions Of A King),"" where someone should have told the band that ""I awoke on the roadside in the land of the free ride"" would be considered third rate lyrics even for Bon Jovi. (Even if the song has an unbeatable hook.) Aside from that minor glitch, ""Sam's Town"" comes crammed with the kind of American Character songs that populate the Springsteen/Mellencamp universe of cars and seekers, like ""Uncle Jonny"" and the title track.

Overall, The Killers' sophomore effort is more hit than miss. And I am willing to give them the benefit of a bonus half/star just on the fact that they were unwilling to coast on their triple platinum laurels and challenge themselves. They may not be up to their ""Born To Run"" yet, but at least they didn't cut a ""Fairweather Johnson.""",From Sin City to Atlantic City,1161648000,

From the classic anthem ""Girls Just Wanna have Fun"" to the emotional bulls-eye of ""Time After Time,"" Cyndi and all her friends established the pattern that would follow for the rest of her career. Cyndi found songs to match her one-of-a-kind voice and would deliver them with style.

That she had a knack for plucking gems from obscurity also helped. The Brains' apocryphal ""Money Changes Everything"" is one such example, ditto for ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Colors/dp/B00000266K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Colors</a>'s"" rocking ""Change of Heart."" She was such a colorful fusion of styles and personality that the singles on this ""Essential"" collection still often sound buoyant and alive even now.

On ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Twelve-Deadly-Cyns-and-Then-Some/dp/B000002AM9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Twelve Deadly Cyns and Then Some</a>,"" Cyndi wisely chose to include ""Sally's Pigeons"" (co-written with Mary Chapin Carpenter, of all people), where the emotional heft matched the ambition, where the title track here didn't.

That ambition also lead to Cyndi's activism. ""True Colors"" has become something of a gay anthem, a call to recognize yourself as the person you are. It became the Nom De'Tour of Cyndi's summer 2007 tour for the Human Rights Campaign (along with Debbie Harry and Erasure, among others), and her tireless work on behalf of the Matthew Sheppard Foundation and other causes. Her timeless music couples with her work for the future.

Her attempt to broaden the style works OK on ""Sisters of Avalon"" and ""Unhook The Stars,"" but I would have happily traded them (or ""When You Were Mine"") in for ""What's Going On."" All is forgiven however, by finally finding ""The Goonies R Good Enough"" on a proper US Cyndi Lauper CD. A quickie knock-off to a Steven Spielberg screaming kids movie, it is all the things great about Cyndi's hits; melodic, energetic and sing-along-quirky.

Blige recorded vocals for a remix version of ""F for you"", a song by British electronic garage-house duo Disclosure. The remix was re-recorded for release as a single and became a Top 10 hit on the UK Dance Chart. Inspired by its response, Blige moved to London where she spent a month recording in RAK studios, collaborating with a host of young British acts. These sessions resulted in a whole new album, one which is set to rejuvenate MJB's career; she is coming hard with it, totally reinventing her sound. From her urban hip-hop days next to P. Diddy to Disclosure's deep house, she has come a long way. Often accustomed to, but not worn out by personal hardship, MJB is synonymous with soul-baring honesty and a roller-coaster range of emotions. ""The London sessions"" is proof of her evolution as an artist, a great example on how music has no boundaries. Personal favourite tracks include ""Right now"", mixing her deep, heartfelt vocals with Disclosure's smooth, yet detached, production (works a treat), and ""Doubt"", a pure, raw, anthemic ballad so real, it hurts (not since her ""No more drama"" days have I heard this much emotion from her). Shaping up to be one of her best albums, she did right taking a leap of faith. ""I was never expected to do more, jump further, move the extra mile. But breaking boundaries happened for me...

4,9.0,False,"12 16, 2010",A17814AD8EWTN4,B004EKDE5A,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},-------------,"Tank has always been one of the most overlooked and underrated R&B singers since the 2000's. Though he is an exceptional contemporary R&B singer that has had a small handful of solo hits and modest record sales, he is probably more know for his excellent songwriting and production of other major R&B artists. In a lot of ways, I like to think Tank is kind of like a very very poor man's R. Kelly (Just Speaking in terms of chart success, not Poor Man in terms of talent). Much like R. Kelly, Tank normally writes, produces, plays and sings his own music along with the music he contributes to other artists. He has worked with a extensively long list of grade A R&B singers over the past five years, like Jamie Foxx, Omarion, Donell Jones, Joe, Keith Sweat, Marques Houston, Pleasure P, Fantasia, Keri Hilson, Toni Braxton, Chris Brown, Monica and Day 26 just to name a few... And while Tank has never been a truly standout artist/producer/songwriter, he should be a lot more popular as he makes some of the best modern day R&B music out, weather its his music or someone elses. And while I do think he is very underrated, he has managed to have 4 successful singles, 900,000 records sold amongst his first three solo albums, and he's gotten nominated for four grammy's, two of those nominations were for his own solo music. But even with that very impressive resume, he still tends to get overlooked quite often, and unfortunately I think that trend will continue on this long awaited Now Or Never album...While I'm sure he will have a decent first week sales (His last album, 2007's Sex, Love & Pain managed to move 100,000 in the first week surprisingly), Now Or Never will most likely fall off very fast much like his last album. But never the less, that doesnt detract from his super talent.

Like I stated above, Tank has never really had that ""Breakthrough"" success in terms of his solo career. He's one of those artists who has a hit here and there and sells a decent amount of records (Enough to keep him afloat), but never truly breaks into the mainstream for good. The first time people really remember hearing Tank, was probably with his first solo hit, the slow jam ballad ""Maybe I Deserve"", which ended up being his first and only top 40 hit and probably his biggest hit to date. The single was lifted from his 2001 debut album, Force Of Nature, which managed to go gold, probably due to the success of that hit. Now though, Force of Nature has slipped out of print, and is considered a rare collectors item if you can manage to get your hands on a copy. Force of Nature itself though, was honestly a pretty miserable album, which is probably why it only had one hit. It was very awkward and it sounded like Tank didn't really know what he was trying to accomplish with the record. The production was bad, the songwriting was sub-par at best, and the songs were just kind of boring, which is why I'm kind of surprised people are willing to pay upwards of 50 dollars for the album. Besides the two singles and maybe one other track on the album, the rest of the album was very bland. So when it came time for round two from Tank in late 2002, people were definitely skeptical. His second album, 2002's One Man, was unfortunately much to similar to his debut. Again besides the singles (the title track and a party track titled ""Let Me Live""), there wasn't a whole to offer on the album. Although I will admit, it was a step forward from his last album, as there were at least a few tracks on the album that were worth listening to more than once. But overall, One Man still wasn't up to par with other contemporary R&B albums being released at the time, not even close really. Not to mention the album failed to have even one single achieve chart success, causing the album to flop even harder than his debut. So after his first to albums failed to meet expectations (Critically and Commercially), Tank disappeared for quite a lengthy period of time, although he was still producing and writing for other artists, but he wasn't getting a whole lot of attention for it. Tank didn't resurface in the music industry as a singer again until 2005 when he released a promotional single titled ""I Love Them Girls"", which also went unnoticed, though it was a fantastic stripper anthem lol So in early 2007, when he finally started to make his official comeback as a solo artist with his first single from his third studio album, Sex, Love & Pain, it had felt like he was gone for more than five years, especially since a lot of people didn't even know he released an album back 2002. So needless to say, the anticipation for Sex, Love & Pain was high. Especially since he finally started to get more recognition for his production credits on other artists records, most noteworthy his work on Jamie Foxx's Unpredictable album which ended up being one of the best and most successful albums of 2005/2006. So like I said, expectations were sky high (Including mine). The Sex, Love & Pain album ended up being a pretty successful album for him, especially since the first single ""Please Don't Go"" ended up being one of the more popular R&B singles of the year, and serving as the true comeback record for him earning him two grammy nominations. All in all, Sex, Love & Pain was by far his best album at the time, mostly because his production and songwriting had gotten sooooo much better over that five year gap between albums, probably due to how in demand he was during that time as a producer for other big name R&B artists. Not to mention he was taken in as part of one of the best R&B production teams of the past 10 years, The Underdogs. But with that said, and even though SL&P was his best album, I still can't deny that it was disappointing somewhat. It could have been the sky high expectations, or it could have been the fact that the album itself just wasn't that great still. Don't get me wrong, it definitely wasn't nearly as bad as his first two albums, it wasn't bad at all, but it still felt like it was missing something that made it a truly good or great standout R&B album...

So now, three and a half years later, we are in kind of the same spot with his newest album, 2010's Now Or Never. Tank has had a tendency to take his sweet time with his albums, especially his two most recent albums. So if Tank has perfected anything in his 10 year run in the music business, its that he has learned how to form very high anticipation for his albums. Just like Sex, Love & Pain, Now Or Never's expectations and anticipation was sky high after a three and a half year wait for the album, and over two years worth of push backs and leaks. This album has gone through it's fair share of modifications, in fact, its probably nothing like what the first original tracklisting suggested it to be. Now Or Never's original title was Sex, Love & Pain II: The All Night Experience, and it was intended to be released on his original label Blackground Records. But with almost the entire album leaked to the net before there was even a single released for the album, and a decreasing album budget with an already sinking label in Blackground, in early 2009 Tank decided to jump ship and take his talents to the SUPER label Atlantic Records, which i fully supported seeing it as he would probably finally get some good promotion and a good album budget (I mean have any of you seen the music video for his huge 2007 single ""Pleas Don't Go"" from Blackground records??? Talk about a low budget video). So he scrapped the entire Sex, Love & Pain II album in summer of 09, and started working on a totally new record, to be titled...you guessed it, Now Or Never. So in summer of 2010 when the rare up tempo banger/baby maker ""Sex Music"" was released as the first single to lukewarm ratings and chartings, the album was again pushed back from it's September 21st release date, to a November 2nd release, making the anticipation grow even more. And I honestly don't understand how ""Sex Music"" was such a flop on the charts, because it had everything Tank would have needed to have a radio smash...it had banging club beat, seductive lyrics, and instantly catchy hook, not to mention the song was just flat out great and super addictive. So honestly I was glad that the single floppped, because I just didn't want it to get over played on the radio, and ""Sex Music"" ended up serving more as a promo single than an actual single. But then unfortunately, the album got pushed back yet again, this time to a December 14th release date. The second single released was a typical Tank ballad about heartbreak in ""Emergency"", which was another great classic Tank track, that reminded a lot of fans and critics alike of Pleasure P's baby maker ""Under"", which coincidentally was also produced by Tank. And again, similar to ""Sex Music"", ""Emergency"" never really gained any steam on the charts, so far peaking at number 47 on the R&B charts, which signifies another failed single for Tank's Now Or Never album...But at least it didn't get pushed back this time, and now the album has finally arrived. And after just one listen I could immediately tell that it was by far Tank's best album. What seperates Now Or Never from Tank's previous albums, is the production and the vibe of the album. On Tank's previous records, like I stated earlier, the production and songwriting had a tendency to be bland at times (Actually more often than not), causing his previous albums to drag in some parts. But on Now Or Never he steps up not only his production, but his contributors also bring their A game. Like on ""Scream"", the Jim Jonsin produced piano tinged ballad about screaming, and not just sexually, is definitely a standout. And on the smooth babymaker ""Amazing"", Tank uses his soft falsetto to caress the gentle beat, and what Tank claims to be his favorite track on the album ""Can I"", is also another extremely steamy baby maker and probably the best song on the album, which if played at the right moment it's promised someone will become pregnant. And the mid tempo acoustic driven ""Keep It 100"" is another standout heartbreak ballad, produced by Tank and his production team Song Dynasty, who dominates the production on the record. And the Drake assisted mid tempo club banger ""Celebration"", produced by R&B duo The Stereotypes, is probably Tank's last hope for a hit single on this Now Or Never album, as its probably one of the more catchy songs on the album. The cover of Bonnie Rait's love ballad ""I Can't Make You Love Me"" is also surprisingly another standout, as Tank makes the track his own with his amazing vocals on the track. Thats another thing I want to point out about this record, is that vocally Tank has never sounded better than he does on this album. His smooth vocals just glide across all of these tracks almost effortlessly, making it very clear as to why I have always thought Tank has one of the best most mature contemporary R&B voices among the rather large group of modern day R&B singers. All in all, Now Or Never isn't going to be the best album of the year by any means, nor will it have any sort of tremendous chart success either, but it's the first Tank album that there isn't an ounce of disappointment in me about the record. It's the first Tank album to truly meet and exceed my expectations, which i was honestly starting to become skeptical if he would ever be able to give us a truly great or even a solidly good contemporary R&B album, after his first three records were mediocre at best.

The sound quality on the streaming version of this is pretty good. Since its' mostly rap with the instrumentation being a background sound any loss of fidelity is totally acceptable to me on a streaming version.

The version I hear when I listen to it (downloaded version) has just the piano and vocals. Nice, but no production whatsoever. It's great, but not this. The video version is much livelier.

The song itself is pretty impressive though; it lets us know who Sara actually is; what she wants; needs and most importantly, how she thinks! Lyrics are subtly interesting and the piano work is somewhat infectious, albeit simple.

I've heard the samples here, and although they weren't enough to make me want to purchase the album, it doesn't take away from this awesome single and I will still give them another go someday!

Dopes To Infinity contains the single `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and the popular tracks `Dead Christmas' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning.'

In every way, this is a strong album from the band. The lyrics, production, performances and songwriting are all just on top form, with Dave's Vocals in particular really coming in to their own. Stylistically, the album maintains some of the psychedelic touches of its predecessors but overall relies more on riffs and grooves.

Highlights include the memorable `King Of Mars,' as well as the aforementioned `Negasonic Teenage Warhead' and `Look To Your Orb For The Warning,' all of which demonstrate what Monster Magnet were capable of when at their best.

In summary, Dopes To Infinity is a strong, confident and well written album that contains a lot of classic material and is more than worth a place in any Stoner Rock collection.

If you are a fan of Temple of the Dog, Soundgarden, and/or Audioslave, please note that solo work is very different material.  I love his voice and style which is why I pre-ordered this album.  I have most of his collection, even though I didn't care much for his 2009 pairing with a Timbaland, where the two took a turn down a twisted path.

This album has Brendan O'Brien as producer and, funnily enough, the drums are mostly homegrown loops. Where this normally bothers me, it works on this album since Cornell is more about his voice and guitar skills.

There is an eclectic mix on this album.  Sample it first before pulling the trigger.  Some are total AC and others are unique, catchy tunes.  In any event, this is a wonderful effort.

I typically try to include a handful of songs as my tops of an album, but after numerous listenings, that is still pretty hard. They are all equally good for various reasons (lyrics, hooks, chorus).

Obviously, Nearly Forgot My Broken Heart is solid (it was the first single). Murder of Blue Skies, Only These Words and Higher Truth stick out, as the tempo is faster than the majority of tracks. Our Time in The Universe is catchy as hell and you also get a remix on this album. It almost connects back with Scream, but in a much better way.

Having had numerous plays, I will be completely shocked if Our Time in the Universe isn't a huge success!  Which version? Hmm. Not sure  as both are great.  If you are a Delain fan, it is like choosing which version of We Are The Others is ""better.""",Nailed It!,1442534400,

I m a big fan of calvin harris/rihanna collaboration . ""We found love"" was a great hit so is this one. The result is amazing . Those two always produce something great when working together . Hope those two will keep collaborating . I want more !

While the video itself won't earn video of the year and is a bit repetitive , its very well filmed, well done (esthetically speaking),and quite original . Rihanna looks so stunning and drop dead gorgeous in the video .

The cd cover itself is a huge let down , they could have done so many things better than this .I wish they used rihanna on the cover  .

Mrs. Miller was the epitome of a loveable housewife singing music with the most non-hip and non-understanding of innocence and that is what makes this album great... She tried so hard and was so diligent and serious.  And the risks she took!  Sure she could have sung opera or inspirational music, and got laughed at far less (actually probably ignored) - - but whether or not her recording career was a joke on HER, the fact that she accepted the challenge to record such unlikely (then) pop and rock and roll material is what made her GREAT.

Red and Love Story are her two best songs - I am not quite sure which is better.  I think that one is like the french fries on my emotional 'plate,' and the other, ketchup.  The color of ketchup, very handily, matches my analogy to a 'T.'

Love Story describes 'budding' love - Red is all about lost love.

If you enjoyed Love Story (if that is your cup of tea, as it is mine) - I guarantee that Red will 'hit' you just as hard in the right ways - if, that is, you've ever lost a love in life or miss someone.  Which I have.

I don't think it matters if you are a man or a woman - the lyrics will 'catch' you either way

Hours and hours of listening enjoyment - and emotional roller coasters (the best part) - all for like a $1.29 here on Amazon.

Buy the song - you'll get your money's worth after like 1 play -- 2.  Tops.  Everything beyond that is just 'icing' on the cake - trust you me.

A wise investment if ever I made one.",One of Taylor's all time best songs - hands down.,1388620800,

Even now, I would say it's still one of the best CD's I've bought in the last five years. Naturally my interest was raised once again with Nick's latest solo effort after hearing the lead single ""Jealous"" on the radio, so I went ahead and bought that album as well. While I wouldn't go as far as to immediately rank it as one of my all time favorites, it's a solid record and one that probably won't be leaving the player for a while.

I won't give a tedious track by track review, but any fan of catchy, uncomplicated pop music should find something to enjoy here as there's quite a bit of variety. Highlights for me include the bouncy ""I Want You,"" the tribal influenced ""Wilderness,"" and the 80's flavored throwback ""Teacher,"" but there really isn't a true dud in the bunch.  I was kind of expecting something a little more dance or electronic oriented, which we do get tastes of, for sure, but overall the disc maintains more of a smooth yet upbeat R&B style vibe reminiscent of a lot of mid-90's pop music, sprinkled with other influences throughout. While straightforward enough to be commercially safe and not alienate or put off any segment of listeners, there is still enough going on to keep it fresh and interesting in today's market. As for whether Nick truly is ""all grown up"" is debatable - this isn't exactly the most profound stuff you'll ever hear, lol - but he does share writing credit on most of the tracks and it's always admirable when artists have a hand in creating the product their names are attached to.

I will say a quick word about the ""explicit"" content. Yes, he does drop the F-bomb in two or three songs (in a non-sexual context) but frankly, I doubt it's something that would jump out at you unless you made a point to go looking for it. That's just my opinion, but I know some people are concerned with that sort of thing, so take it as you will. Otherwise, like I said before, I think it's a great record any fan of pop music in general should enjoy. (My only complaint, if I absolutely had to make one, is that it runs a bit short - the standard edition barely breaks 38 minutes total.)",A catchy and uncomplicated pop record,1418342400,

If you're looking 4 more WHINING vocals from the lead singer you can forget it. He has finally reached P*berty and no longer sounds like Eminem. The lyrics to me just seem so much more mature and the group has collaborated so well with each other to create such an amazing piece of ART. I've noticed the roaster contains some big name producers and that is probably what everyone is experiencing on the shift in sound. But it's a very small semi change. The change actually seems like it's for the better. ""I Can Wait Forever"" has got to be one of my favorite songs on this album. It's a stand out track and is also an amazing ROCK BALLAD. Almost every song on this album is a 5 star track and the leads singer's voice really sounds so soothing and beautiful this time around. The hooks to the CHORUS lines are beyond ADDICTIVE.

She parts the clouds with unyielding optimism in The Skies Will Break; the song opens with a catchy Bm-A-D-G, Em-D-F#m-G piano figure, then flips to a punching G-A-Bbdim7-Bm progression that carries the song to heights unprecedented for Rae, only to break to nothing for the heart speaks in whispers chorus line  a perfect mix of dynamics and drive.

Husband-and-wife Randy and Pamela Copus have hit on a winning formula, combining Randy's guitars and Pamela's flute and harp along with keyboards and synthesizers to create a hypnotic sound that mesmerizes and enthralls. It's no wonder that they consistently chart on Billboard - they have clearly connected with their audience by continually delivering pleasing melodies and luxurious arrangements.

Having recently reviewed Damayanti and now Deep Still Blue, I have noticed that 2002 has developed a consistent style that comprises deliberate, measured pacing. I haven't heard a 2002 song so far that's faster than mid-tempo. Each track takes its time, unfolding at its own leisure, allowing the listener to bask in all of its rich sonic intricacies. This is a refreshing change of pace from most albums of any genre, where tunes careen from one style to another, sometimes to jarring effect. Instead, 2002 stays true to its particular style or theme and is all the more successful for it.

This consistency of methodology is a major reason why Randy Copus is quickly becoming my favorite, strictly-New Age guitarist. Rather than a flashy display of virtuosity, his lead- and rhythm-guitar playing is as deliberate and measured as the expansive songs themselves. Each note he picks delivers precise and maximum impact, and his chords are as comforting as floating clouds. This is masterful technique in itself. The full effect of Randy's approach can be heard on such stunning tracks as ""An Ocean Apart,"" ""Little Angel,"" and ""The Voyage Home.""

Pamela Copus is equally impressive in her subtle flute and harp playing. I'm not a flute and harp fan, but she makes it very accessible and enjoyable. Again, like Randy, her musical goal with her instruments is not to dazzle but to help paint a vivid, sonic portrait. Sometimes the flute trades lines with the guitar and other times it harmonizes with it, while the harp provides unobtrusive, decorative fills here and there. The result is a sound that is very cinematic.

Vocals also play a part in the proceedings, although not in the traditional sense. For the most part, the occasional vocals are wordless (""vocalese"") and are very angelic and choir-like. The title track has actual lyrics written by Randy and Pamela's daughter Sarah and has an entrancing, hypnotic sound that I can only describe as New Age hippie folk, and I mean that in a good way.

Deep Still Blue is another gem in 2002's stellar catalogue, and as ""Flight of the Swan"" is to Damayanti, ""An Ocean Apart"" is the jewel in the crown here - although the entire album is a delight from start to finish. Deep Still Blue and Damayanti are definitely two of my desert island picks.",The RajMan Review,1318723200,

This is the very first Hollywood Undead album that I ever discovered, and its the one that got me into their music in the first place!  I admittedly haven't been a fan for very long, but this album is the one that hooked me and got me to fall in love with HU, eventually causing me to go collect all their previous albums.

Having now experienced all their previous records, Day of the Dead feels like a good mixture of more light-hearted songs (like War Child) with more serious songs (Dark Places, Live Forever).  My particular favorite is How We Roll just because it is so high-energy and fun, plus I love the wordplay in the line, were packing heat because its cold out here  I also quite like the song Does Everybody in the World Have To Die for its slightly experimental-sounding backing music, along with the fascinating way the title phrase fluidly progresses from being a question to an affirmative statement.  Additionally, for anyone who misses Funny Mans deep, surprisingly sexy voice, youd better give Guzzle, Guzzle a listen (bonus song on the deluxe version).

Oh, and if you're wondering exactly which version to get (theres a normal deluxe version, an itunes bonus song version, and a version in Best Buy), definitely pick up the Best Buy version.  It comes with the regular deluxe tracks, but also the tracks Sing and F--- the World. While I do recommend you track down all the bonus songs if you can, Sing is absolutely the most beautiful song HU has yet released, so I strongly suggest you try to get the Best Buy version solely for that.  Even if you dont, though, Day of the Dead is still an excellent album in all respects, and any version of it is definitely worth owning.","Sing, sing just a little bit more than they're asking for",1476403200,

What l I love about her success (being a voice teacher myself who spends her days listening to singers), is that she produces her voice in such a healthy, clean , natural way and that people love it.  There are no effects added to her voice digitally it is just pure talent.

The differences between those later collaborations (after the Count, like the one with Coltrane) is that the producers took away The Duke from his Big Band. The Coltrane album is just the two of them. That's great, but Duke made his claim to fame with his big band, and this album with Count allows two of the greatest big band leaders of all time to go at it. The results are just splendid.

My children quickly learned the words to this song and would sing it in church without looking at the lyrics.  Since our music director's passing, it has taken on an even more powerful meaning.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s

It was not until Capitol leaked ""Ordinary World"" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December.

The keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes and John Jones. The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge.

The guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo, former player with Frank Zappa. His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums ""Roadrage"".

The music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino, California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.

Simon LeBon later performed the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit.[2] The performance was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia.

The lyrics to ""Ordinary World"" were written by Simon Le Bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend David Miles; the others being ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" (1988) and ""Out of My Mind"" (1997).",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s,1404172800,

After hearing seeing them live, I immediately went out and bought their self-titled debut and every SECOND of the album was up to pitch, fantastic rock music.  So when I heard they were coming out with another album, I was ecstatic.  Though this album is a little more 'hard' then their first CD, it's still amazing and those acoustics made famous by Todd are still there.  Their first single 'Hey Now' is actually more like their old stuff.  My favourite song on the CD would have to be 'Hero', a brilliant done song.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac remake, the beginning doesn't really sound like Tantric but once it gets to the chorus, you can hear their signature sound.  From start to finish this album delivers and I cannot WAIT to hear more.  If you liked the first album from Days of the New, Tantric's first CD or just love rock music you won't be disappointed with this.

That was my review after the first week of having the CD, now I have a little more to say.  Tantric's 'After We Go' is a timeless album, it hasn't left my CD player since it's release.  It's one of those albums that you can put on replay for the rest of your LIFE and still want to hear more.  Each track is amazingly good, it's like a big juicy apple pie, rich and delicious.  The opener, 'Chasing After' is a fast paced starter, Hugo's vocals are extremely well done here, lyrically good as well.  'After We Go' is one of my favourites (tied with about 5 others), the background vocals surpass Hugo's...strange, no.  The talent of this band is overflowing.  'Falling Away' is musically, one of the best songs I've heard.  The guitar work is actually intelligent.  The first single 'Hey Now' is a single I actually love to listen to.  'Hero' which was my favourite song when I first got the CD has now dropped a fair bit, it's still brilliant - a somewhat sweet anthem, if that is an apology, I accept.  'The Chain' is a Fleetwood Mac cover, very well done of the classic, the chorus is hard edged, I love Hugo's vocals on the 'and if you don't love me now, you will never love me again', chills.  'Change The World' is a great song to start off if you're a new Tantric fan, it's not as experimental, still extremely well done.  'Just Once' is my favourite song, I think when I listen to it, I go into a different world, the guitars and vocals put me into this dream and I never want to wake up.  These last few songs are what I call the creme de la creme, the best damn music I've ever heard in a long time!  All of these are tied with 'After We Go' for my favourite after 'Just Once' - that didn't really make sense.  In any case, 'Relentless' is lyrically amazing, Hugo's vocals are sexy as hell.  'Alright' - what can I say, the chorus ... if you're a woman, you will get caught up in the vocals, I am telling you, there is nothing sexier than Hugo's vocals.  Todd - you are a god.  Always will be.  'Before' really, there isn't much more I can say ... if I had a thesaurus close by I would look up some more incredible words to describe it's brilliance.  Lastly, 'Awake', a great closing song but every time I get there I wish there was more.  I hit repeat for the time being and I am counting down the days for the next album!!",one of the best follow up albums,1079740800,

The bands at such events can really be pretty varied. Sometimes, a really good cover band or a really solid band at the beginning of their career is hired, though it's pretty often just a group of locals who get together on weekends to play. Anyway, with all of those bands, and at all of those dances, there's a common moment, when the instantly recognizable violin hook begins and the crowd absolutely floods the dance floor. That's pretty much the central ritual, I think, of all those Texas dances. The band, no matter who they are, must be able to play ""Amarillo By Morning,"" and everyone must dance to it. Goodness, I even remember that from prom, when the types of music and tastes varied widely, but everyone, even the people who hated country music, danced to ""Amarillo by Morning.""

So, obviously, it's a great song. It's got that beautiful violin hood that soars over the well-sung and pretty melody. The words are classic country--both melancholy and touched by the romanticism of pursuing the cowboy/rodeo dream. There's no wonder that it's as popular as it's long been. It's absolutely the quintessential country song, the one (among many very good ones) for which George Strait will always be most remembered.",The Quintessential Country Song,1309564800,

What I love about it is the absolute control and power that the lead singer has in his voice.  His ability to sing in the low registers  without any raspy, broken up tones is miraculous considering how loud this man has been pushing out songs for so long.  I couldn't believe it was DISTURBED when I looked it up and bought it.  The song ends with the vocals so clean, powerful and in tune that I'd say there are not many vocalists that match this type of excellent singing.

They do total justice to the song.  Considering that the same singer that wailed out the classic ""The Sickness"" is singing like this says a lot about how much work this man does to perfect his voice.  I haven't heard the album.

5,,False,"06 14, 2016",A1CS70DT7ZPCJJ,B000MSTZV0,{'Format:': ' Audio CD'},KaseyG,"Back in 1979, I had Bonnie Pointers HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU song on one of those K-tel compilation albums and thought it was an ok hybrid of Disco and vintage Motown but I found her voice kind of thin and reedy not unlike Diana Ross.  When Big Break Records released this remastered deluxe CD I decided to make a blind-buy purchase since I loved what they had done with a large chunk of the Pointer Sisters catalog.

At first I wasn't that impressed, but this album has grown on me and so have Bonnies vocal stylings. She displays such versatility here as she tackles lite jazz on FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, another retro Motown offering on WHEN IM GONE and some red-hot funky R&B on AH SHOOT. But my favorites on the album are the stripped-down, acoustic numbers MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD) and the piano ballad MY EVERYTHING. These are just beautiful in their simplicity and allow Bonnies voice to shine through and really move the listener.

Sound quality is terrific on this remaster and best of all is that theyve included the 12 versions and single versions of FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. Both are better than the album versions with a hot bass-driven break in the former but the latter must be heard to be believedits an extended mix that has this mesmerizing instrumental interlude where the frantically-scrubbed guitars and screeching violins battle it out. It sounds like something out of the famous PSYCHO shower scene and will give you goosebumps.

This albums a grower and is definitely the best of the solo Pointer Sisters offerings. FIVE STARS.",Best Solo Pointer Album,1465862400,

So, you could look at this as their comeback song, and it greatly tides over our thirst for everything MB20. First off, the lyrics are incredible just like they are with any MB20 song, with lyrics like, ""I'm waking up at the start of the end of the world/ but it feels just like every other morning before."" The song is catchy and well-written, and overall just well done. And even though this is a rather successful single, it doesn't really sound it. In fact, most of the best songs on their albums were singles anyhow. The bridge is also great musically, and the only thing that could get me down on this song is the chorus. While it is a great chorus for concerts, and to get you pumping, it just seems like more could have been done to it.

Don't ruin it by listening in snippets.

Just like the movie, I do not want to give anything away in this review.  Be assured I have listened to the entire soundtrack.  I enjoyed this score as much as, if not more than, ""The Social Network"" score.

Reznor and Ross have matured on their third outing with Fincher.  From the soft piano halfway through ""Just Like You"", the percussive tone of ""Clue One"", the electronic feel of ""Clue Two"", the piano with synthesizer behind it on ""Background Noise"", ""Procedural"" contains strumming, synth, guitar solo, and some weird sounds yet it never crosses into too much, ""Something Disposable"" sounds like it was recorded using just that, and so on and so on....  This score does what it is supposed to do which is build suspense.  Listening to it on it's own, I feel as though I am in the moments of the film and at the same time am listening to a really good album.  The album has a way of reaching out and grabbing you instead of just being something coming out of your speakers.  There was a lot of emotion put into this project.

THIS is what scores and soundtracks should all be like.  I wish some of the hacks that score movies will take a lesson from Reznor and Ross.  THIS is how you do scoring!!  This score also proves that the Oscars won by Reznor and Ross for ""The Social Network"" were not a fluke.  I expect this to be nominated for an Oscar and if it isn't I will be shocked.  BUY THIS ALBUM.",This Score is truly 'Amazing'.  IT DESERVES YOUR ATTENTION!!,1412380800,

It jumps around in price and it sat in my wish list until it dropped reasonably enough for me.  The album cover looks different from what they are currently showing on Amazon but I actually like the CD cover better which has the silver Terminator skull (with red eye) against a black background.  Call me crazy in this digital age but I still prefer to purchase my music on CD.

This is my third score by Lorne Balfe.  I've previously enjoyed his work on ""Blackwood"" and ""Sons of Liberty"".  Balfe is part Hans Zimmer's score production company known as Remote Control Productions.  It is home to quite a few composers who are mentored by Zimmer and he often collaborates with many on various projects.  After hearing the past few Terminator scores and not really finding them that interesting, I had high hopes that this one by Balfe would finally bring the scores back from the past and into this future.  I am happy to say that this one certainly does just that.  Lorne Balfe successfully pays tribute to Fiedel while also developing his own themes and style to the score.  Fiedel's epic themes can be heard in a few cues like ""Better Days"" (track 2), ""It's Really Me"" (track 12), and most prominently in ""Terminated"" (track 22).  Balfe's interpretation of the theme in the last track is really outstanding and it's something that fans have been waiting for.

Balfe has created his own original score but you can hear hints of the classic Terminator sound throughout the music.  The composer achieves this through his use of similar keyboard effects, percussion, strings, and heavy brass instrumentation that he spins & weaves into a sound that becomes distinctively familiar to fans of the iconic music from the early films.  To Balfe's credit, he does not merely give us only a repeat of that which has already been done, but he also develops new themes and electronic ""riffs"" of his own that are quite enjoyable.  I really liked the thematic music in track 11, ""John Conner"" and I also enjoyed the new and unusual electronic sounds found in ""Family"" (track 17).  There are few cues that give Balfe a chance to slow things down a bit like ""Sarah & Kyle"" (track 5) and ""Alcove"" (track 13) but this is largely an action heavy score.  Like Fiedel's previous scores, however, I found this one to be full of interesting effects, sounds, rhythms, and ambience that makes for an entertaining listen.  I like scores that allow you to mentally picture a scene and I would say that this one does just that.  Listening to pieces like ""Sacrifice"" (19) does this quite well.  The big swooping crescendos as one character saves another and the almost angelic sounding strings praising the heroic deed can certainly give you the mental images found within the music.

I had to wait a long time to finally get a copy of this but it certainly was worth the wait.  The CD contains 22 tracks and runs around 1 hour and 12 minutes.  There is a 12 page CD insert that contains track listings, production credits, orchestra credits, and a special thanks section from Balfe, Zimmer, and Paramount Pictures.  There are plenty of photos from the movie as well.  Some are two page spreads, full pages, and several smaller photos.  This a great score from Balfe and I appreciate the nod to Fiedel's music, as well as, the excellent original music too.  I recommend!",Finally...a CD version of this score!,1447632000,

I know some people may turn their noses up at me for calling Mozart the greatest, but he was better than Beethoven because of his operas, and he was better than Bach because although Bach is more complex, intricate and elaborate in his instrumentation and harmony, Mozart is more perfect.

We forget what it was like to be walking on the clouds, not a care in the world, breathing, laughing and feeling true joy.

Johnny co-wrote it with his soon-to-be-wife June. Their daughter Rosanne said, ""The song is about the transformative power of love and that's what it has always meant to me and that's what it will always mean to the Cash children.""

I have this on my running playlist. There is are mariachi-style horns and guitar-drum beat which pace this excellently for runners looking for more pep in their step.

""Love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
I fell in to a ring of fire.""

I full recommend ""Ring of Fire"" by Johnny Cash.

Great beat! An anthem that everyone who knows God comes to realize...

In our pursuit of happiness, we end up discovering ""There ain't no life worth doing what I did to You!"" and our deep need for forgiveness...
The happiness comes in knowing that He gives forgiveness freely and shows us the fulfillment of a real ""pursuit of Happiness""
They know the same God who gives Joy & Happiness as David Crowder&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Oh-Happiness/dp/B002NSOHIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Oh, Happiness</a>
Americans will especially relate to this as we understand the ""inalienable right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness...""
and where it has lead many of us...

Happily, I have experienced & been able to give the true measure of love:
""Some times you leave the one's you love, but if it's love they won't give up, 'cause they know war's raging...""

""I've been working all night, can't You help me to believe...This song ain't nothing, the song can't set you free!""
Many of us have literally worked ALL NIGHT in our pursuit & understand that songs of joy will only take us so far, we to know the One who gives perseverance & endurance (Romans 15:5)

I don't really understand how one can objectively review a song.  It's entirely a matter of opinion, and a review of a song is basically pointless.  I can understand reviews for albums because you can rate an overall collection of songs, especially when the review comes out before the album.

But youtube exists now.  It's not like you need to base your purchase on what other people think.  You listen to the song, and if you like it enough to want it on your mp3 player (or in better quality than youtube)... (or if you want to support the artist), you buy the mp3.

Not a battle, but not quite a merger, either, since the Count's contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel. There's more than an hour of good music on here, laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras. Popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible. This is one of those rare CD's in which the booklet is almost as good as the music. This one reveals that during this 12-hour late-afternoon-to-early-morning session, one of Ellington's long-time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague. Also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics. Basie hated Columbia's first idea to bill the date as a competition, and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art. The end result is an album whose sales over 40 years have been hurt because no one knows its name. The cover finally chosen says ""The Count Meets the Duke"" but in larger letters it declares ""FIRST TIME!"" and then adds ""2 Great Orchestras"" and finally states ""Duke Ellington and Count Basie."" The label Columbia/Sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says ""Duke Ellington MEETS Count Basie"" which makes no sense because they had known each other since the 20's. If you already like both orchestras, you'll want to own this late career session. If you want an introduction to each group in its waning years,  the CD serves nicely for that, too. This disc really jives, so don't be expecting any ballads here.","Big band jazz: loud, fervent, it's a last hurrah...",1054080000,
